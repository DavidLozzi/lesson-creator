      "How many times have you read or heard the narrative of Jesus’ birth? When interacting with a familiar Bible story, it is easy to simply skim over it and assume we understand all there is to know about it. Rather than taking that approach, spend time this week meditating on Luke 2:1-20. \n",
      "The detailed account of His conception and birth, as well as the details between those two events provide the believer with a gift of God’s grace that is far too important to gloss over. This event preceding Jesus’ ministry, death, and resurrection lays the foundation for a close and thoughtful study of the Gospels. \n",
      "The details around the conception and birth of Jesus provide reason for amazement and strengthen our faith. Consider the detail of Mary having been a virgin, fulfilling the prophecy of Isaiah 7:14. Jesus was born in the small town of Bethlehem, fulfilling the prophecy of Micah 5:2. He was born into the family line of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—fulfilling God’s promises in Genesis 12:3; 17:19; 28:14. \n",
      "All of this ought to cultivate a sense of wonder at the divine intervening in the human world, and an amazement at the detail to which God worked out His plan. \n",
      "Additionally, recalling the details of Jesus’ birth ought to generate affirmation in the believer’s heart and mind. The uniqueness surrounding the birth of Jesus affirms His claims of being the Son of God. \n",
      "Finally, the birth narrative should grow the anticipation of the believer. At the end of the New Testament, the book of Revelation sheds light on the end of sin and death, the final judgment of the living and the dead, and the new heaven and the new earth. These promises can seem distant or unlikely; however, the joy and gratitude that comes from understanding Jesus’ birth narrative can cultivate confidence in and anticipation of the future promises of Jesus. \n",
      "Luke 2 invites us to behold our God, who—out of His great love for us—“emptied himself by assuming the form of a servant, taking on the likeness of humanity” (Phil. 2:7). Jesus came to earth to rescue sinners. The angels’ announcement to the shepherds in Luke 2:10 is also for us and for the nations: “Don’t be afraid, for look, I proclaim to you good news of great joy that will be for all  the people.” \n",

Did you know that just between the time of the prophet Malachi and the birth of Jesus, at least 400 years had passed? Even though God’s people had to wait, God always keeps His promises.

      "Today’s Bible story reminds us that Jesus came to save us. Jesus left heaven and was born a baby so that He could live a perfect life for us. Then He died on the cross for our sins and rose from the dead. The birth of Jesus is good news because it meant that Jesus had come to save us! Let’s say our big picture question and answer again.

Even when God gave His people—Israel—His good commandments, they could never fully obey.\n",

Loida, her husband, and other volunteers also went on prayer walks to pray for the people in the city who did not know Jesus.

We find the wise men who sought Jesus with persistence, Herod whose power was threatened by this newborn King, and others such as Simeon and Anna—both who demonstrated a remarkable devotion to the Lord. \n",
      "In Luke 2, Simeon and Anna are described as people who are deeply committed, faithful, and devout followers of God. Simeon is described as one who was old in years—near death—and desperately waiting for the Messiah to come. So, you can imagine the significance of that moment as Simeon saw the Christ child and rejoiced. \n",
      "Anna, also old in years, had been faithfully worshiping God through fasting and prayer in the temple for 84 years. It is easy to imagine the joy she had upon seeing Jesus in the temple and her eager desire to tell everyone about this glorious child. \n",
      "Both Simeon and Anna came upon the incredible blessing of seeing, celebrating, and worshiping Jesus because of their faithfulness to the Lord. Both were in the place the Lord wanted them to be, faithful to God over the years, and daily looking for the Lord in everything they did. \n",
      "Imagine if your daily decisions were influenced by similar factors. You were deeply committed to being in the places God wanted you to be, you were seeking to be faithful over the decades, and in all that you did you were pursuing what the Lord might have for you. What would have to change in your life, in your motivations, and in your decisions to make this true of you? In what ways would you see and experience the blessings of God’s good gifts even more? \n",
      "Faithfulness like that of Simeon and Anna doesn’t earn any additional degree of salvation before God. But it can produce more opportunities to see the work of God in your life, even if it’s only because you’re more attuned. What a blessing that would be for each of us as well. \n",

      "Only Jesus can save us from our sins. In our Bible story, Simeon and Anna both recognized that the Savior had come. They rejoiced because the Savior had finally arrived! We can praise God for sending Jesus to save us as He lived a sinless life, died on the cross, and rose from the dead.\n",

Last week, we saw that the time had come for Jesus to be born. Jesus fulfilled God’s promise when He came to earth and was born in a lowly manger. Jesus is our Immanuel, God with us. But many people still did not realize that He was the promised Savior. In today’s story, Mary and Joseph took Jesus to the temple to be dedicated.

      "What gives you hope? It seems like a simple question, and most of us who regularly attend church likely know the “right” answer to the question. However, it’s the most important question for every person who has ever lived because your answer will determine your security and eternity. Unlike the hope the world has to offer, we can have a sure and steadfast hope that will never fail. \n",
      "In the Gospel accounts of Jesus’ baptism, we see John the Baptist offer words of warning that lead us back to the question, what gives you hope? \n",
      "John warned the Pharisees sternly that no family, tradition, or outward practice is sufficient to save people from the wrath of God due to them for their sin. People are saved only by the grace of God received through faith and repentance. \n",
      "The same is true today. Though we may be tempted to find our hope in the faith journey of our parents, grandparents, or even children, those experiences are not sufficient to save. Though it is a gift to have family members who have placed their faith in Christ, our hope does not come from them. \n",
      "Similarly, no tradition is sufficient to save either. Though we may uphold the traditions and practices—baptism, the Lord’s Supper, prayer, and so forth—those practices alone are not able to save from sin and secure eternity with God. \n",
      "John the Baptist made it clear that the faith that leads to repentance brings the certainty of salvation. The larger context of the New Testament reminds us that this repentance is always paired with genuine faith. When these are present, the believer will bear the fruit of the Spirit. \n",
      "What gives you hope? The only true answer is that we must put our hope in Jesus. Only faith in His finished work on the cross rescues us from sin and death, empowers us to live for Him, and promises us life with God forever. \n",

      "New Christians may find themselves wondering, Now what? What do I do? To answer these questions, we may talk with those new believers about Bible reading, prayer, community, and mission. Though these are all good and essential things, they alone do not capture Jesus’ initial call to  His disciples. \n",
      "When Jesus first began calling disciples, He used two words: “Follow Me.” He didn’t say “Clean yourself up” or “Work harder.” He said, “Follow Me.” \n",
      "The call to follow Jesus is a call to our souls to find rest. He invites us to be with Him and enjoy Him. Jesus’ invitation is not to be amazing, to do great things, or even to get to work. Jesus’ initial invitation is to follow Him. \n",
      "Jesus has most certainly called His followers to go and do good works, but the order in which we heed His calling and instructions is vital to our spiritual health. \n",
      "It’s easy for us to get caught up in the activity of God, the work of His mission, and the effort we must engage in to grow as He desires for us; however, these are not to  be first. \n",
      "God calls us to come to Him; draw near to Him; and to see a glimpse of His goodness, beauty, splendor, and grace. And it is only in seeing these realities that we will go and do faithfully. For if we seek to go and do before we come and see, we will find ourselves in a spiral of constant despair, feeling like we are falling short or equally as dangerous, feeling like we must earn our way to God. \n",
      "Jesus’ call to His disciples to come and see is the same invitation that we have today. Whether we have walked with God for decades or are new to the faith, our greatest need is to draw near to God and experience His glorious grace. It is then that we will see Him for who He truly is, understand ourselves more fully, and then live faithfully for His glory.\n",

      "The phrase “take away” has many different connotations and applications. For a four-year-old, it means someone stole their toy. For a basketball player, it means a steal. For a math teacher, it means subtraction. So, what does it mean that Jesus came to “take away the sin of the world”? \n",
      "In John 1:29, as John the Baptist saw Jesus coming along the banks of the river where he had been baptizing people and calling for repentance, John said, “Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of  the world!” \n",
      "This statement raises a question that’s important for every person: What does it mean that Jesus came to take away the sin of the world? A look to Hebrews 10 brings clarity as we seek to allow Scripture to help interpret the question. \n",
      "The writer of Hebrews reminds us that the Old Testament sacrificial system was good, but not enough. Though this system proved to be a faithful response to the call of God for His people prior to Christ’s arrival, it was never intended to be a permanent means of atonement for the sin of God’s people. \n",
      "Hebrews 10:12-14 says, “But this man [Jesus], after offering one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down at the right hand of God. He is now waiting until his enemies are made his footstool. For by one offering he has perfected forever those who are sanctified.” \n",
      "Jesus was the perfect sacrifice because He lived a sinless life and died once as a single offering for sins. All who trust in His death and resurrection are eternally forgiven as His sacrifice has satisfied the wrath of God on their behalf. \n",
      "This is what it means that Jesus takes away the sin of the world: Jesus died once for all, that those who trust in Christ would no longer be held captive by their sin and that they would be able to stand before God, redeemed by the blood of Jesus shed for sins. This is the greatest “take away” the world has ever known.  \n",

      "Light and darkness are contrasted throughout the Scriptures. In John 3, Jesus explained to Nicodemus the hope and grace of God and the means by which He saves. Consider what Jesus was saying as He emphasized this contrast in this conversation. \n",
      "In John 3:19-21, Jesus said, “This is the judgment: The light has come into the world, and people loved darkness rather than the light because their deeds were evil. For everyone who does evil hates the light and avoids it, so that his deeds may not be exposed. But anyone who lives by the truth comes to the light, so that his works may be shown to be accomplished by God.” \n",
      "Jesus said that judgment is coming—and has arrived—because people loved the darkness more than the light. Ultimately, Jesus was referring to Himself, having entered the world to overcome the darkness. But as John 1 says, He was not recognized as the light, even by His own people. \n",
      "Some two thousand years later, the question is, do we too love the darkness, or have we truly received the light? And how can we know? Jesus helps us answer  this question. \n",
      "One might summarize Jesus’ response this way: if you love the darkness, your deeds will be evil. If you love the light, your works will be obvious evidence of the power of God. The evidence of whether we love the darkness or the light is found in the way we live. \n",
      "Do you live in a way that expresses your love for light or for darkness? Is there a clear picture of the power of God in your decisions, actions, and words? Do people see the work of God and hear of His power when they interact with you? \n",
      "It’s easy to answer these important questions with aspirations, but we cannot convince God of what is not true. And even further, our aspirations mean nothing without a deep dependence on God’s transformation for our lives. Though we find evidence of what we love in how we live, ultimately God looks at the heart. Our lives will be evidence for loving God above all else. In our faithful pursuit of the light, the evidence will show itself.  \n",

      "A clear reality that echoes throughout the New Testament is that God sends those He saves. Jesus commanded His disciples to go and tell others about Him. (Matt. 28:18-20) The story of Jesus and a Samaritan woman in John 4 also provides reminders of this idea. \n",
      "Upon the Samaritan woman’s hearing that God Himself was standing before her, she left her water—the very thing she had come to the well for—and returned quickly to her town to tell of this man. \n",
      "Her response was not to run from Jesus but to expend her energy bringing others to Him: “Come, see.” At the very least, she concluded that He was the Messiah. At the very most, she had surrendered to His authority over her life and was now trusting in His power to forgive. Either way, she was moved to go and tell. \n",
      "Immediately following this, Jesus used the question of His need for food to exhort the disciples to go and tell as well. After telling the disciples that He is fulfilled by doing the work of God, Jesus shared with His friends that they too were created to participate in the work of God— sowing and reaping by bringing men, women, boys, and girls  to Jesus. \n",
      "Ultimately, Jesus called these men to follow Him so they would experience joy in His presence forever, glorify Him, and invite others to do the same. He saved them to participate in the mission of God to make known the hope found only in Him.  \n",
      "And the same is true of us as well. Those whom God has saved are also sent by Him so that people in their communities and all over the world can receive the invitation to come and see the Savior—Jesus Christ. \n",
      "Jesus calls us to Himself and then He sends us to go. When we take part in the mission of God, we are demonstrating that we love Jesus more than anything. Before He ascended to heaven, Jesus also promised that we don’t take on this mission alone. He will surely be with us—by the gift of the Spirit. \n",
      "The Lord saves us and commands us to share the hope of the gospel. As we participate in His mission, He promises to be with us and produces joy within us as others come to faith in Him. Jesus is worthy. \n",

Like this demonstration, sometimes we try to fill our lives up with things that never fill us or leave us satisfied.

      "God is loving. God is love. What’s the difference between these two statements? If God is simply loving, then He fits a particular definition of love; however, if God is love, then He Himself is the definition. For God to be loving does not necessitate that He is love, but if God is love, then He most certainly  is loving. \n",
      "Why does this matter? Well, a simple observation of culture demonstrates that there are multiple definitions of love. Some may suggest that love is a feeling or an action. Some may suggest that love is a noun or a verb. But if God is love, then we ought to look no further than Him and His Word to discover what love truly is. \n",
      "In light of this, where Scripture describes God, we find imagery of what love is. And when Scripture describes love, we discover more of who God is. First Corinthians 13 utilizes a litany of adjectives to describe love, ultimately describing God Himself. \n",
      "In this text, we find how God loves and, in particular, how He loves us. God loves us with patience, kindness, satisfaction, humility, thoughtfulness, sacrifice, truthfulness, and hope. This description ought to stir our hearts toward the worship of the God of love and move us in the direction of this type of love toward others. \n",
      "The ultimate example of God’s love is Jesus, who said, “Love one another. Just as I have loved you, you are also to love one another” (John 13:34). First John 4:16 says, “And we have come to know and to believe the love that God has for us. God is love, and the one who remains in love remains in God, and God remains in him.” \n",

There are times when remaining faithful comes easy. There are days when doors open for sharing the gospel and other days when a door is slammed shut. \n",

He has promised to not leave or forsake those who trust in Him. \n",
      "The believer can also find great hope in knowing that when we are tempted, rejected, or discouraged, Jesus Himself has been there. In Luke 4, we find Jesus experiencing the high of widescale praise and affirmation at His teaching followed immediately by a gut-wrenching dismissal by those in His own hometown. \n",
      "After Jesus taught in the synagogues of Galilee, news of His teaching spread and people gathered to hear from Him. They praised Him as He read from the Scriptures. But the response He found upon entering Nazareth was quite different. \n",
      "Jesus stood up to read from the scroll of Isaiah and teach how the Scriptures pointed to Himself. Rather than being received with praise, He was questioned. Though they were amazed at the power of Jesus’ words, they doubted that Jesus—the son of Joseph who had grown up among them—could be the Savior of the world. They became even more enraged by His claims as Jesus confronted their unbelief with His unwillingness to perform signs, and His desire to take the good news to all people. Jesus’ next stop? Capernaum to share the same message. \n",

      "“I stand amazed in the presence of Jesus the Nazarene, and wonder how he could love me, a sinner, condemned, unclean.” These words from Charles Hutchinson Gabriel’s classic hymn “My Savior’s Love” have been sung and treasured for more than a century. When Gabriel first released this song in a 1905 hymnbook, it served as a reminder to the church of the deep love of God, His work through Christ, His presence in all circumstances, and their cause for celebration and amazement. \n",
      "In all the rich truths of the five stanzas of this great hymn, the first line may be most striking: “I stand amazed in the presence of Jesus the Nazarene.” Why? Because it reminds us of the unfathomable reality that we are able to stand in the presence of God by no other means than God’s gracious work through Jesus. Paul reinforced this idea in his Acts 17 address at the Areopagus: “For in him we live and move and have our being, as even some of your own poets have said, ‘For we are also his offspring.’” (Acts 17:28) \n",
      "What causes you amazement? What brings a sense of awe? Are you guilty of being captivated by a sunset but being indifferent to the Savior? Are you left breathless by the miracle of new life, only to be largely unaware of the miracle of sustained life? \n",

      "This week, set your mind to remember that gift of God’s grace found in being able to stand in the presence of God because of the work of Christ applied to you. Take time to remember the gracious gift of God’s sustaining power in your life—keeping breath in your lungs, relationships in your life, and function to every other part of your being. Stand amazed in the presence of Jesus, who sustains your very life and has cast such incredible love on an undeserving sinner. \n",

      "SAY   In the Old Testament, the presence or power of God produced fear in people. This was a rightly oriented fear because when they recognized God’s holiness and complete authority, they were able to rightly see that they were not holy nor did they hold any authority. Fear of God can lead us to repent, like Isaiah, because we exalt God to His rightful place and understand that we are sinners who need forgiveness. In today’s story, Peter had a similar response to Isaiah when he recognized Jesus’ power and authority.  \n",

      "Faith is a common theme throughout the Bible. We may not find the word faith on every page; however, in nearly every description of what God expects of His people, there is at least an indication of faith. Throughout Scripture, we read that faith is the means by which God is pleased with His people as they chose to trust Him. \n",
      "Hebrews 11 emphasizes the significance of faith by unpacking how God has been saving His people through faith from the beginning. From creation to the first family and on and on throughout the lives of individuals, tribes, and nations, God uses faith as the evidence of who belongs to His kingdom and the means by which He gives hope. \n",
      "So, what exactly is faith? According to the author of Hebrews, “Faith is the reality of what is hoped for, the proof of what is not seen” (Heb. 11:1). \n",
      "To be clear, this does mean that it is possible to have faith in something other than the truths of the Bible, the work of Christ, and the promises of God. We may place our faith in a future spouse, job, experience, or accomplishment; however, according to the Bible, only one object of faith is truly saving before God, and that  is Jesus. \n",
      "What is the object of your faith? Do you have hope in the unseen promises of God? Does the object of your faith look more like a whimsical desire for your own good, or is it confidence in the wonderful work of a life-giving Savior? In the grand picture of life, there is no more important question than this because the object of your faith will most certainly determine the direction of  your eternity. \n",
      "The individuals described in Hebrews 11 put their faith in God’s promise of a coming Christ; therefore, their actions revealed their trust and dependence on the Lord. Ultimately, this produced faithfulness in their lives and blessing from God. \n",
      "Hundreds of years from now, will your life be associated with this type of faith? Let the faith of Abraham, Sarah, Moses, and others inspire you to take risks in obedience to following Christ. Pray for a faith that actively trusts that God is who He says He is and holds tight to the confidence that God keeps  His promises. \n",
      "Terms to know\n",
      "Faith: the trustful human response to God’s self-revelation via His words and His actions. Faith yields in the believer a confidence or sense of assurance as he or she continues to trust God through His promises. (Heb. 11:1)\n",

God is in all places at all times and is always with His people.\\\\nChrist Connection: \\\\nGod did not abandon His people. The prophet Jeremiah encouraged God\\\\u2019s people. He said God was going to save His people from captivity and raise up a new King\\\\u2014a forever King\\\\u2014from David\\\\u2019s family.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPREPARE\\\\nPrior TO TEACHING THE SESSION\\\\n\\\\nLeader Bible Study\\\\nGod\\\\u2019s Word is living, active, sharp, powerful, and profitable. (Heb. 4:12; 2 Tim. 3:16-17) The Bible indicates that by the power of the Holy Spirit, God\\\\u2019s words teach, rebuke, correct, and train us so that we are complete and equipped for the work that God has created us for. The Bible is full of stories, illustrations, commands, warnings, and heart-provoking questions that provide for us everything we need.\\\\nYet, throughout our lives, we intentionally disregard God\\\\u2019s words for us. We are guilty of the same thing that Jeremiah 29:19 describes\\\\u2014not listening to God\\\\u2019s words. \\\\nWhen we know God\\\\u2019s words and know that God\\\\u2019s words are good for us, why do we continuously neglect them? The answer is simple: We prefer our own way. \\\\nThroughout the Bible, God warns us by direct command and historical example. We find explicit instructions to obey God\\\\u2019s words and explicit assurances of the pending consequences for refusing to obey His words. We find instances where God executes His justice on those unknowingly ignorant toward His instructions and those blatantly defiant toward Him. God takes His words seriously and expects that we do the same. \\\\nWhat is your relationship to God\\\\u2019s words given to us in the Bible? Are you distant, aware, knowledgeable, or in awe? Are you dismissive, forgetful, interested, or obedient? God\\\\u2019s expectation is that we would hear and obey His words, that we would seek His truth and live His truth, and that we would know His instructions and heed them. \\\\nThe reality is that we all will fail to do this, but there is hope because of the One who has the title \\\\u201cThe Word.\\\\u201d Jesus, the living Word of God, lived a perfect life in full obedience to God and His words, yet He died the death that we deserve so that in our failure, we might find hope. \\\\nThe answer to our struggle to listen and obey God\\\\u2019s words is not simply trying harder, but pursuing a greater love of God, a greater hope in His Son, and a greater trust in His Spirit. These will lead us to greater obedience. His expectations are great, but His mercy is more.\\\\nPeople to know\\\\nJeremiah: prophet who proclaimed God\\\\u2019s judgment upon Judah and Jerusalem and proclaimed hope and salvation.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nGATHER Supplies\\\\nKeep a regular supply of the following items available at all times: Bibles, pens or pencils, markers, crayons, colored pencils, scissors, glue or tape, paper.\\\\nWELCOME\\\\nActivity Page\\\\n\\\\u201cGod Is Faithful Maze\\\\u201d activity page\\\\nSession Starter (Option 2)\\\\nindex cards, 4\\\\nLEARN\\\\nIntroduce the Session\\\\ncountdown video\\\\nBig Picture Question\\\\nBig Picture Question Poster\\\\nReview the Timeline\\\\nGiant Timeline\\\\nTell the Bible Story\\\\n\\\\u201cJeremiah Encouraged God\\\\u2019s People\\\\u201d video\\\\nBible Story Picture Poster\\\\nQuestions from Kids\\\\n\\\\u201cUnit 16, Session 1\\\\u201d questions from kids video\\\\nMissions Moment\\\\n\\\\u201cPartner with Send Vancouver\\\\u201d missions video\\\\nmap of Canada or the world\\\\nKey Passage Activity\\\\nKey Passage Poster\\\\n\\\\u201cThe Lord Your God (Zephaniah 3:17)\\\\u201d song\\\\nworship song of your choice (optional)\\\\npool noodle (optional)\\\\nindex cards, 1 per kid\\\\nLOVE\\\\nReview & Bible Skills\\\\nSmall Group Timeline and Map Set\\\\nworld map\\\\nLIVE\\\\nActivity Choice (Option 1)\\\\nplay dough\\\\nActivity Choice (Option 2)\\\\nBig Picture Question Poster\\\\nsmall cups, 15\\\\nrubber bands, 1 per kid\\\\npermanent marker\\\\nJournal and Prayer\\\\nJournal Page\\\\n\\\\u201cBible Story Review\\\\u201d activity page\\\\nWELCOME\\\\nWELCOME Kids\\\\nGreet each kid as he or she arrives. Use this time to collect the offering, fill out attendance sheets, build relationships, and help new kids connect to your group.\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002Has someone ever encouraged you in some way? How were you encouraged? Who encouraged you? What did you do in response? \\\\nActivity page (5 minutes)\\\\nInvite kids to complete \\\\u201cGod Is Faithful Maze\\\\u201d on the activity page.\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002What message did you find? God made a promise to His people. Do you think God kept His promise? Today, we\\\\u2019ll hear a story about the prophet Jeremiah. Jeremiah spoke God\\\\u2019s message to His people. Jeremiah encouraged God\\\\u2019s people. Let\\\\u2019s get ready to learn more. \\\\nSESSION STARTER (10 minutes)\\\\nOption 1: Pass the Message\\\\t \\\\nGuide kids to form two single-file lines. Whisper an important message to the first kid in each line. Sample messages:\\\\nTomorrow morning at 8:30, the bus will depart from 415 Newberry Street.\\\\nToday at 11:15, we will serve grilled cheese and pickles with chips for lunch.\\\\nIn four minutes, call 555-8909.\\\\nChallenge the players to whisper the message to the next player in line until the message reaches the end. Invite the last players to say the message aloud. The first team to get the message accurately to the end of the line wins. Play again, using a different message, as time allows.\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002That was fun to deliver those messages quickly. In the Bible, God gave important messages to prophets who then shared those messages to God\\\\u2019s people. Today, we\\\\u2019ll hear about a message the prophet Jeremiah shared with God\\\\u2019s people. \\\\nOption 2: What Would You Say?\\\\nBefore the session, write the following scenarios on index cards:\\\\nTake cover! A tornado is coming your way! \\\\nDon\\\\u2019t eat that sandwich! It\\\\u2019s full of dirt!\\\\nBe careful! That plate is hot and will burn you! \\\\nDon\\\\u2019t get in the ocean! There\\\\u2019s a shark! \\\\nForm four groups and distribute the scenario cards. Instruct each group to read the scenario and take turns acting out how they would respond to the warning.\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002If someone gave you one of these warnings, what would you do? Would you listen, or would you ignore it? Today, we\\\\u2019re going to see how God sent prophets to warn His people. We\\\\u2019ll find out how the people responded. Do you think they listened? \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLEARN\\\\nTHE STORY OF THE GOSPEL\\\\n\\\\nINTRODUCE the Bible Story\\\\nIntroduce the session (3 minutes)\\\\nShow the countdown video as you transition to introduce the Bible story. Set it to end as the session begins.\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002Hi, everyone! My name is [your name]. I\\\\u2019m excited you\\\\u2019re here with us today. Did anyone bring their Bible today? Hold up your Bible if you brought it. [Distribute Bibles to kids who need one.]\\\\nThe Bible is God\\\\u2019s Word. It is one Book with many stories, all fitting together to tell one bigger story. That story is the gospel\\\\u2014the good news of how God saves sinners through His Son, Jesus. One important part to understand in the gospel story is sin. In today\\\\u2019s story, we\\\\u2019re going to see how the sinful ways of God\\\\u2019s people brought trouble to them, but God\\\\u2014in His grace and love for them\\\\u2014sent an encouraging message through the prophet Jeremiah. \\\\u2009\\\\nBig picture question (1 minute)\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002Our big picture question for today and the next few weeks is, Where is God? That\\\\u2019s a great question. How would you answer if someone asked you that? [Allow kids to respond.] The answer we\\\\u2019ll memorize is this: God is in all places at all times and is always with His people. Let\\\\u2019s say that together: Where is God? God is in all places at all times and is always with His people.\\\\nCan you think of a time when God\\\\u2019s people wondered where God was and then He provided for them in some way? Think about the stories we\\\\u2019ve learned about in the Bible. When things got tough for God\\\\u2019s people, they often wondered where God was. Every time, He was still there. And today, He is still with His people. \\\\u2009\\\\u2009\\\\nReview the timeline (1 minute)\\\\nShow the giant timeline. Point to individual Bible stories as you review.\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002Remember that every story in the Bible is part of God\\\\u2019s big story. Over the last few weeks, we have seen how God\\\\u2019s people were taken captive in Babylon. The people were far away from the land God had given them, but they were not far from the God who had given it. \\\\nIn the stories we will hear, we will learn how even in exile, God was with His people watching over them. He promised them that one day, they would return to the land, and when they did, they would return to Him as well. Today\\\\u2019s story is called \\\\u2018Jeremiah Encouraged God\\\\u2019s People.\\\\u2019 Let\\\\u2019s see where it fits on the timeline. [Point to the story on the timeline.] \\\\u2009\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLEARN the Bible Story\\\\nTELL THE BIBLE STORY: VIDEO OR STORYTELLER (10 minutes)\\\\nOpen your Bible to Jeremiah 29\\\\u201330. Use the Bible storytelling tips to help you tell the story, or show the Bible story video \\\\u201cJeremiah Encouraged God\\\\u2019s People.\\\\u201d Use the bold text to retell or review the story.\\\\nJeremiah Encouraged God\\\\u2019s People\\\\nThe Northern Kingdom of Israel had turned from God and been destroyed by their enemies. The Southern Kingdom of Judah was also in trouble. God was angry with the people of Judah. They did not obey Him. They lived however they wanted to live. They sinned and were unfaithful to God.  \\\\nGod loved His people. He didn\\\\u2019t want to destroy them. God sent prophets like Jeremiah to warn the kings and people to stop sinning and to turn back to God, but they didn\\\\u2019t listen. So God sent His judgment by bringing the king of Babylon to Judah. \\\\nKing Nebuchadnezzar (NEB yoo kad NEZ uhr) invaded Judah and took some of God\\\\u2019s people\\\\u2014the best and most intelligent men\\\\u2014to Babylon. He left Jehoiakim in Judah as king. When Jehoiakim rebelled, Nebuchadnezzar invaded again and took more people captive. Zedekiah was on the throne in Judah when the prophet Jeremiah sent a message to Babylon to encourage God\\\\u2019s people.  \\\\nThis is what Jeremiah\\\\u2019s letter said: \\\\u201cThis message is from God to the people He sent from Jerusalem to Babylon. While you are in Babylon, build houses and live in them. Plant gardens and grow your families. Work and pray for the good of your city. The exile will last 70 years, and then I will come. I promised to bring you back to the land of Judah, and I will keep My promise. \\\\n\\\\u201cI know My plans for you,\\\\u201d God declared. \\\\u201cMy plans are for your good. You have hope and a future. You will seek Me and find Me when you search for Me with all your heart.\\\\u201d God promised to restore His people\\\\u2019s riches and bring them back home. \\\\nJeremiah told the people that they would experience more troubles. In the face of their powerful enemies\\\\u2014the Babylonians\\\\u2014God knew they would feel hopeless. So Jeremiah shared what God would do. God said, \\\\u201cI will set you free and raise up a king for you. Do not be afraid or discouraged. I will save you and be with you. I will bring you back to your land, and you will rejoice. You will be My people, and I will be your God.\\\\u201d\\\\nChrist Connection: God did not abandon His people. The prophet Jeremiah encouraged God\\\\u2019s people. He said God was going to save His people from captivity and raise up a new King\\\\u2014a forever King\\\\u2014from David\\\\u2019s family. \\\\u2009\\\\nREVIEW THE BIBLE STORY\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002In our Bible story today, we saw how God\\\\u2019s people had disobeyed God and refused to listen to the warnings He sent through the prophets. This isn\\\\u2019t the first time God\\\\u2019s people had disobeyed Him. Can you think of another time God\\\\u2019s people sinned and disobeyed Him? [Allow a volunteer to answer.] Because God is good, righteous, perfect, holy, and just, God must punish sin. Sin always has consequences; but even when we are faithless, God is faithful.\\\\nGod\\\\u2019s people faced consequences for their sin, but God never gave up on them. God had warned them time and time again, yet they were unfaithful to Him. God had every right to turn His back on them, but what was His message? Look at Jeremiah 29:11-14. [Choose a volunteer to read the verses aloud.] Through Jeremiah, God told His people that He was not done with them. Rather than abandoning them, God showed His people that He loved them and had a plan to save them. Isn\\\\u2019t that amazing? \\\\nGod\\\\u2019s message to His people gives us hope as well. We can trust that just as God was faithful to be with His people in exile, God will be faithful to us. Through Jesus, we have the same hope that God will be our God and we will be His people. \\\\u2009\\\\nChrist connection\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002God did not abandon His people. The prophet Jeremiah encouraged God\\\\u2019s people. He said God was going to save His people from captivity and raise up a new King\\\\u2014a forever King\\\\u2014from David\\\\u2019s family. \\\\u2009\\\\u2009\\\\n(Tip: Use Scripture and the Gospel Plan Poster to explain how to become a Christian. Make sure kids know when and where they can ask questions.)\\\\nQuestions from kids (3 minutes)\\\\nShow the \\\\u201cUnit 16, Session 1\\\\u201d questions from kids video. Prompt kids to discuss:\\\\nHow can we not feel so discouraged when we might fail at something?\\\\nDo you know an encouraging Bible verse you could share with someone? What is it?\\\\u2009\\\\nMissions moment (3 minutes) \\\\nDisplay a map and point to Vancouver. \\\\nSAY\\\\u2002Vancouver is on the west coast of British Columbia, Canada. More than two million people live in Vancouver, and over half of them in the city speak a first language other than English. More than 200 languages are spoken in the city. Vancouver has beaches and mountains, making it popular among tourists. It is a city that needs many churches because it has many people. But there are not many churches in the area. \\\\nPlay the missions video. Explain that because Vancouver has many people from many different backgrounds, the city needs many different churches to meet the needs and cultures of the people in the area.\\\\nPray for churches in North America to partner with, pray for, and help churches already working in Vancouver. Pray that churches and individuals will also help start new churches in Vancouver to meet people\\\\u2019s needs.\\\\nKey passage ACTIVITY (5 minutes)\\\\nBefore the session, write the words of the key passage on separate index cards, preparing one card per kid. Depending on the size of the group, you may need to write multiple words per card. If your group is large, form two or more groups and prepare extra sets. \\\\nShow the key passage poster. Lead kids in reading aloud Zephaniah 3:17 together.\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002God promises to be with us and He always keeps His promises! Let\\\\u2019s learn the key passage together so we can remember that God is with us! \\\\u2009\\\\u2009\\\\nDirect kids to form a circle. Choose a volunteer to be the pointer and stand in the middle of the circle. Give the pointer a pool noodle or instruct her to use her pointer finger to point. Give a key passage card to each kid around the circle. The pointer will point the noodle or her pointer finger at the kid with the first word card, signaling him to say the word(s) on the card. The pointer should continue pointing in order of the key passage until kids say the entire key passage. If time allows, choose a new volunteer to be the pointer and play again.\\\\nLead kids to sing \\\\u201cThe Lord Your God (Zephaniah 3:17).\\\\u201d You may also choose to sing a worship song of your choice.\\\\nPray (2 minutes)\\\\nInvite kids to pray before transitioning to Love.\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002Lord, You are a faithful and loving God. Thank You for loving and saving Your people. Thank You that while we were still sinners, Jesus died to save us when we trust in Him. Help us always remember that truth and to tell others this good news. In Your name we pray. Amen. \\\\u2009\\\\u2009\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLOVE\\\\nTHE GOD OF THE GOSPEL\\\\n\\\\nLOVE God by Applying the Story\\\\nREVIEW & Bible skills (5 minutes)\\\\nDistribute Bibles and display the Old Testament Mediterranean Map. Guide kids to open their Bibles to Jeremiah 30. Explain that Babylon was a real place. Choose a volunteer to find Jerusalem (G10) and Babylon (E11) on the Old Testament Mediterranean Map. Explain that Babylon was where God\\\\u2019s people were taken captive from Jerusalem and lived in captivity for many years.  \\\\nConsider comparing the Old Testament Mediterranean Map to a modern-day map to help kids understand where these stories took place. (Tip: Locate the areas in and around modern-day Israel [G10].) \\\\nChoose a volunteer to read aloud Jeremiah 30:3.\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002 God\\\\u2019s people were taken captive to Babylon as punishment for their sins. Living in captivity would be discouraging and very hard. While God\\\\u2019s people were in captivity, God never abandoned them. God sent encouragement through the prophet Jeremiah. God promised that He would be their God and they would be His people. One day they would be free from exile. \\\\u2009\\\\nGROUP DISCUSSION (10 minutes)\\\\nAsk the following questions. Lead the group to discuss.\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002 What did Jeremiah say to God\\\\u2019s people that was an encouragement? \\\\u2009\\\\nRemind kids that Jeremiah told God\\\\u2019s people that He was not going to abandon them, but that He would restore them and bring them back from Babylon. Lead kids to understand that God was just to punish their sin, but that God\\\\u2019s plans were always for their good. \\\\n(Option: Choose a volunteer to read Jer. 29:10-11.)\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002 How do we search for God with all of our heart? \\\\u2009\\\\nRemind kids that God is not lost; God is everywhere. Discuss how we are naturally drawn away from God and toward sin. Lead kids to understand that we must make a conscious effort to draw near to God. Encourage kids to do this by calling out to God in prayer, reading His Word, engaging in fellowship with other believers, and humbly recognizing that we need Him at all times.\\\\n(Option: Choose a volunteer to read Jer. 29:12-14.)\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002What hope do we have when we face hard times? \\\\u2009\\\\nGuide kids to realize that our hope is in Jesus. Remind kids that when we trust in Him, our lives are full of hope\\\\u2014both now and in the future. Encourage kids to remember that because of Jesus we have the hope that we have been saved from our sin, all things will be made new, and we will spend eternity with Him.\\\\n(Option: Choose a volunteer to read 2 Cor. 1:10.)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLIVE\\\\nTHE MISSION OF THE GOSPEL\\\\n\\\\nLIVE the Mission\\\\nActivity choice (10 minutes)\\\\nOption 1: Play Dough Multiplication \\\\nPlace a large ball of play dough on a table. Invite kids to each tear off a chunk of the play dough and take it back to their table. Lead kids to then form two balls out of their play dough piece. Then ask kids to take the two balls they made and pinch off a piece from each to make four balls. Finally, guide them to pinch off a piece of dough from each of the four so they have eight all together. Lead the kids to count up all of the play dough balls.\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002How many balls of play dough did we start with? (one) When we all worked together, we were able to multiply the total number to how many? [Let kids shout out the total number.] As disciples of Jesus, we are called to make disciples and begin new churches. Missionaries in Vancouver, Canada, are working to share the gospel with people who don\\\\u2019t know Jesus. We can pray for the missionaries and ask God to multiply churches so that many more people can hear about Jesus and trust in Him. \\\\nOption 2: Knockout\\\\t \\\\nBefore the session, gather three sets of five cups and write the following Bible references on the cups: Psalm 139:7-8; \\\\nJoshua 1:9; Proverbs 15:3; Jeremiah 23:23-24; \\\\nIsaiah 41:10. \\\\nForm three teams of kids. Place each set of cups on a table for each team. Distribute rubber bands and Bibles to each team. Instruct kids to take turns knocking out the cups one at a time.

God is in all places at all times and is always with His people.\\\\nChrist Connection: \\\\nGod did not abandon His people. The prophet Jeremiah encouraged God\\\\u2019s people.

(Heb. 4:12; 2 Tim. 3:16-17) The Bible indicates that by the power of the Holy Spirit, God\\\\u2019s words teach, rebuke, correct, and train us so that we are complete and equipped for the work that God has created us for. The Bible is full of stories, illustrations, commands, warnings, and heart-provoking questions that provide for us everything we need.\\\\nYet, throughout our lives, we intentionally disregard God\\\\u2019s words for us. We are guilty of the same thing that Jeremiah 29:19 describes\\\\u2014not listening to God\\\\u2019s words. \\\\nWhen we know God\\\\u2019s words and know that God\\\\u2019s words are good for us, why do we continuously neglect them? The answer is simple: We prefer our own way. \\\\nThroughout the Bible, God warns us by direct command and historical example. We find explicit instructions to obey God\\\\u2019s words and explicit assurances of the pending consequences for refusing to obey His words. We find instances where God executes His justice on those unknowingly ignorant toward His instructions and those blatantly defiant toward Him. God takes His words seriously and expects that we do the same. \\\\nWhat is your relationship to God\\\\u2019s words given to us in the Bible? Are you distant, aware, knowledgeable, or in awe? Are you dismissive, forgetful, interested, or obedient? God\\\\u2019s expectation is that we would hear and obey His words, that we would seek His truth and live His truth, and that we would know His instructions and heed them. \\\\nThe reality is that we all will fail to do this, but there is hope because of the One who has the title \\\\u201cThe Word.\\\\u201d Jesus, the living Word of God, lived a perfect life in full obedience to God and His words, yet He died the death that we deserve so that in our failure, we might find hope. \\\\nThe answer to our struggle to listen and obey God\\\\u2019s words is not simply trying harder, but pursuing a greater love of God, a greater hope in His Son, and a greater trust in His Spirit.

Should you laugh at a colleague\\\\u2019s derogatory joke? Should you obey God even if it is costly or uncommon among the culture?\\\\nThese major points of decision require a degree of confidence and conviction. The question is not if we have confidence or conviction, but what our confidence is in and where our conviction comes from.\\\\nIn Daniel 1, Daniel was faced with a decision to either honor the Lord or follow the cultural customs of Babylon that dishonored the commands of God. Daniel had a deep confidence in the Lord and a conviction derived from the same. \\\\nPsalm 71:4-5 models the pattern that I imagine Daniel progressed through in determining what to do in this moment of decision: \\\\u201cDeliver me, my God, from the power of the wicked, from the grasp of the unjust and oppressive. For you are my hope, Lord God, my confidence from my youth.\\\\u201d\\\\nThe psalmist displays a deep confidence in the Lord to rescue and a deep conviction to remain hopeful and faithful. This confidence and conviction propel him toward a God-honoring response to his circumstances and direction in his decision making.\\\\nMay this be our mode of decision making as well in all things, where our confidence in the Lord propels us forward and our conviction from the Lord steers our direction for His glory and our joy.\\\\n\\\\nPeople TO KNOW \\\\nDaniel: young man taken from Judah to Babylon by King Nebuchadnezzar.

Because God\\\\u2019s people had sinned against Him, God allowed King Nebuchadnezzar to take over the city of Jerusalem.\\\\nKing Nebuchadnezzar\\\\u2019s leaders gathered a group of young men from among God\\\\u2019s people and brought them to Babylon. The king wanted people who were healthy, handsome, and good learners to serve in his palace. Every day, King Nebuchadnezzar gave the young men special meals. They ate the same food and drank the same drinks that the king ate and drank. They would be trained for three years. Then they would be ready to serve the king.\\\\nFour of the young men from Judah were different from the others in the group. They worshiped the Lord, the one true God. Their names were Daniel, Hananiah (HAN uh NIGH uh), Mishael (MISH eh uhl), and Azariah (az uh RIGH uh). The man in charge of the group gave them new Babylonian names. Daniel\\\\u2019s new name was Belteshazzar (bel tih SHAZ uhr). Hananiah\\\\u2019s new name was Shadrach (SHAD rak). Mishael\\\\u2019s new name was Meshach (MEE shak), and Azariah\\\\u2019s new name was Abednego (uh BED-nih goh).\\\\nEven though Daniel and his friends weren\\\\u2019t in Judah anymore, Daniel wanted to be faithful to God. God\\\\u2019s laws told Daniel what he could and could not eat. Daniel was not allowed to eat some of the food that the king gave the young men. Daniel asked the man in charge for permission to eat other foods.\\\\nDaniel said, \\\\u201cTry this for 10 days. Let us eat only vegetables and drink only water. Then see if we are healthier than the other young men.\\\\u201d\\\\nThe guard agreed. At the end of 10 days, Daniel and his friends looked healthier than the young men who had eaten the king\\\\u2019s food. After that, the guard allowed Daniel and his friends to keep drinking water and eating vegetables. \\\\nGod was happy that Daniel obeyed Him. God blessed Daniel and his friends. He made them wise and smart. They learned lots of new things. God gave Daniel the ability to understand visions and dreams.    \\\\nWhen their training was over, Daniel and his friends stood before the king. The king saw that they were smarter and stronger than all the other young men. They were even smarter than the wise men who worked for the king. Daniel served the king for many years.\\\\nChrist Connection: Daniel was faithful to God, and God blessed him. In an even greater way, Jesus was always faithful to God.

[Allow responses.] Daniel firmly made up his mind to not disobey God. This means that Daniel\\\\u2019s heart was set on God above all else. Daniel was faithful because he was true to his commitment to God. \\\\nWorshiping God is not just about singing songs. Worshiping God is about how we live faithfully to God. In our story today, Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego all worshiped God through their faithfulness to Him and His laws. Even when they were offered more satisfying foods from the king, they obeyed God. Their faithfulness showed that they loved God more than anything else. How did God respond to their faithfulness?

Should you laugh at a colleague\\\\u2019s derogatory joke? Should you obey God even if it is costly or uncommon among the culture?\\\\nThese major points of decision require a degree of confidence and conviction. The question is not if we have confidence or conviction, but what our confidence is in and where our conviction comes from.\\\\nIn Daniel 1, Daniel was faced with a decision to either honor the Lord or follow the cultural customs of Babylon that dishonored the commands of God. Daniel had a deep confidence in the Lord and a conviction derived from the same. \\\\nPsalm 71:4-5 models the pattern that I imagine Daniel progressed through in determining what to do in this moment of decision: \\\\u201cDeliver me, my God, from the power of the wicked, from the grasp of the unjust and oppressive.

This confidence and conviction propel him toward a God-honoring response to his circumstances and direction in his decision making.\\\\nMay this be our mode of decision making as well in all things, where our confidence in the Lord propels us forward and our conviction from the Lord steers our direction for His glory and our joy.\\\\n\\\\nPeople TO KNOW \\\\nDaniel: young man taken from Judah to Babylon by King Nebuchadnezzar.

King Jesus willingly humbled Himself by dying on the cross for our sin. God raised up Jesus and gave Him honor forever. When we humble ourselves and trust in Jesus, God will raise us up to enjoy Jesus in His kingdom forever.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPREPARE\\\\nPrior TO TEACHING THE SESSION\\\\n\\\\nLeader Bible Study\\\\nDaniel 5 contains several notable instances that are reasons to stop, pray, and consider our own lives. One of the most perplexing questions is derived from the words of the queen who entered the scene following Belshazzar\\\\u2019s inability to make sense of the writing inscribed on the wall by an unfamiliar hand. \\\\nFollowing the mysterious inscription, the king called in those who would have been culturally identified as experts at explaining and creating the unseen. To Belshazzar\\\\u2019s disappointment, none of them could explain the inscription or its meaning. \\\\nThen the queen stepped in with a brilliant thought, derived from past experiences. She recommended Daniel, a man who formerly had profound influence and insight and provided this type of help to the previous king\\\\u2014Belshazzar\\\\u2019s own relative, Nebuchadnezzar.\\\\nConsider the personal challenge that arises at the mention of Daniel\\\\u2019s name. It was Daniel\\\\u2019s past faithfulness that opened the door for present opportunity. And the natural question that flows from this realization is this: Does my faithfulness today lay the groundwork for future opportunities? \\\\nIn Matthew 5:13-16, Jesus described His followers as the \\\\u201csalt of the earth\\\\u201d and the \\\\u201clight of the world.\\\\u201d These descriptions of the people of God lend themselves to cultural influence that shows the power, mercy, grace, and goodness of God. And this type of influence always leaves a mark. In Daniel\\\\u2019s case, the mark was so significant that it gave greater influence to his witness. \\\\nWe can\\\\u2019t undo the past, but we can be decisively committed to the next step, the next moment, and the next opportunity. What if you committed to faithfulness one day at a time? And what if your faithfulness marked the people around you in significant ways? Then I would imagine that your faithfulness will lead to future opportunities for greater influence.\\\\nDon\\\\u2019t waste today. Be faithful to your purpose to live as the salt of the earth and the light of the world. And God will use you today and, Lord willing, multiply your efforts and opportunities tomorrow.\\\\n\\\\nPlaces TO KNOW \\\\nBabylon: large empire that absorbed the nation of Judah and destroyed Jerusalem. Nebuchadnezzar was the last great ruler of Babylon.

In our story today, Daniel showed that he loved God by serving Him.  \\\\nSESSION STARTER (10 minutes)\\\\nOption 1: Humble Dependence\\\\t   \\\\nForm two groups of kids. Provide each group with a large bed sheet. Instruct each group to stand on top of the bed sheet. Explain that they cannot step off the bed sheet and they must work together to flip the bed sheet over to its opposite side.\\\\nGuide kids to think about ways they can work together to flip the sheet over. The team to successfully flip the sheet and have kids still standing on it is the winner. \\\\nSAY\\\\u2002\\\\u2009This activity depended on you working together. Not one of you could flip the sheet alone. This also meant that you had to have humility as you recognized that you couldn\\\\u2019t solve the problem on your own. In a similar way, we show humility when we depend on God. Today, we will learn about a time when the king of Babylon showed that he did not have humility.  \\\\nOption 2: Wall of Words\\\\nBefore the session, attach two large sheets of paper or poster board to a wall. Instruct the kids to trace their hand on the paper.

Daniel had to interpret the message for the king and the message was that God was going to humble the king.

God made Himself known to not only Daniel, but also to the king of Babylon. Even when people, like the king of Babylon, do not acknowledge God, God\\\\u2019s presence is still in all places at all times.

Last week, we learned that Daniel chose to be faithful to God and obey Him even in a foreign land.

A thousand guests came to eat and drink with the king. During the party, King Belshazzar brought out gold and silver containers for his guests to drink from. The containers had been taken from God\\\\u2019s temple in Jerusalem; the king was misusing them. While the king and his guests drank, they worshiped their false gods\\\\u2014gods made of gold, silver, bronze, iron, wood, and stone. \\\\nSuddenly, the feast was interrupted. A hand appeared at the wall, and its fingers began writing a message. The king watched the hand, and he was very afraid! His face was pale, and his legs shook. The king stared at the message on the wall, but he didn\\\\u2019t understand what it meant. \\\\nThe king called for the wise men in his kingdom. \\\\u201cIf anyone can tell me what this message means, I will give him gifts and an important job in my kingdom,\\\\u201d he said. The wise men came, but none of them knew what the message meant. King Belshazzar and his guests were upset. \\\\nThen the queen remembered Daniel. Daniel was wise, so Daniel was called to the palace. Daniel saw the message and understood what it meant. The message was from God.  \\\\nDaniel reminded the king about what happened to his relative, King Nebuchadnezzar (NEB yoo kad NEZ uhr). \\\\u201cGod made King Nebuchadnezzar great,\\\\u201d Daniel said. \\\\u201cBut King Nebuchadnezzar thought too much of himself, so God punished him.\\\\u201d \\\\nKing Belshazzar had not learned from Nebuchadnezzar\\\\u2019s mistakes. King Belshazzar did not love God; he loved himself the most and he worshiped false gods. \\\\nThen Daniel read the message aloud and told the king what the words meant. The words on the wall were MENE (MEE nih), MENE, TEKEL (TEK uhl), PARSIN (PAHR sin). MENE meant that God had counted the days of the kingdom. The king wasn\\\\u2019t going to be king anymore. The next word, TEKEL, meant that God had given the king a report card, and he had failed. The word PARSIN meant that Babylon would be split up and taken over by its enemies. \\\\u2009\\\\nThat night, God\\\\u2019s message came true. King Belshazzar was killed, and a new king named Darius (duh RIGH uhs) took over Babylon.\\\\nChrist Connection: God humbled the proud king of Babylon by taking away his kingdom. King Jesus willingly humbled Himself by dying on the cross for our sin. God raised up Jesus and gave Him honor forever. When we humble ourselves and trust in Jesus, God will raise us up to enjoy Jesus in His kingdom forever.  \\\\nREVIEW THE BIBLE STORY\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002 King Belshazzar was a very proud man. The feast he had was in celebration of his kingdom and his greatness. He even invited 1,000 people to celebrate with him! What did King Belshazzar fail to understand? [Allow responses.] The king should have known that he is not great, only God is great. Everything the king had was a gift from God.  \\\\nGod used Daniel to help the king understand the message from God. What did the message say? [Allow responses.] Daniel told the king that his time as king was over. King Belshazzar had failed as king and the kingdom of Babylon would be taken over by its enemies. \\\\nThere is no king like King Jesus. Jesus never failed and He never will. Jesus, the one true King, humbled himself by dying on the cross for our sin. No other king could have done that. Jesus\\\\u2019 kingdom is not an earthly kingdom, but a heavenly kingdom and His reign will never end. Open your Bibles to Revelation 19:16. [Ask a volunteer to read the verse.] Jesus is the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords. When we humble ourselves and trust in Jesus, we will enjoy Jesus in His kingdom forever! \\\\u2009\\\\nChrist connection\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002God humbled the proud king of Babylon by taking away his kingdom.

One of the most perplexing questions is derived from the words of the queen who entered the scene following Belshazzar\\\\u2019s inability to make sense of the writing inscribed on the wall by an unfamiliar hand. \\\\nFollowing the mysterious inscription, the king called in those who would have been culturally identified as experts at explaining and creating the unseen. To Belshazzar\\\\u2019s disappointment, none of them could explain the inscription or its meaning. \\\\nThen the queen stepped in with a brilliant thought, derived from past experiences. She recommended Daniel, a man who formerly had profound influence and insight and provided this type of help to the previous king\\\\u2014Belshazzar\\\\u2019s own relative, Nebuchadnezzar.\\\\nConsider the personal challenge that arises at the mention of Daniel\\\\u2019s name. It was Daniel\\\\u2019s past faithfulness that opened the door for present opportunity. And the natural question that flows from this realization is this: Does my faithfulness today lay the groundwork for future opportunities? \\\\nIn Matthew 5:13-16, Jesus described His followers as the \\\\u201csalt of the earth\\\\u201d and the \\\\u201clight of the world.\\\\u201d These descriptions of the people of God lend themselves to cultural influence that shows the power, mercy, grace, and goodness of God. And this type of influence always leaves a mark. In Daniel\\\\u2019s case, the mark was so significant that it gave greater influence to his witness. \\\\nWe can\\\\u2019t undo the past, but we can be decisively committed to the next step, the next moment, and the next opportunity. What if you committed to faithfulness one day at a time? And what if your faithfulness marked the people around you in significant ways? Then I would imagine that your faithfulness will lead to future opportunities for greater influence.\\\\nDon\\\\u2019t waste today. Be faithful to your purpose to live as the salt of the earth and the light of the world. And God will use you today and, Lord willing, multiply your efforts and opportunities tomorrow.\\\\n\\\\nPlaces TO KNOW \\\\nBabylon: large empire that absorbed the nation of Judah and destroyed Jerusalem.

God is in all places at all times and is always with His people.\\\\nChrist Connection: \\\\nGod is present with us. He sent prophets to His people, even in captivity, and promised to send Immanuel, which means \\\\u201cGod with us.\\\\u201d Jesus fulfilled this promise when He came to earth and was born of a virgin. Jesus is our Immanuel, God with us.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPREPARE\\\\nPrior TO TEACHING THE SESSION\\\\n\\\\nLeader Bible Study\\\\nHave you ever heard someone say something along the lines of, \\\\u201cGod\\\\u2019s promise of the future should give you hope today\\\\u201d? Maybe you\\\\u2019ve heard it dozens of times or said it just as many. In part, this saying stands because we believe the Bible teaches this principle; however, at the gut level, this idea can be challenging to hear and believe. \\\\nIn Isaiah 7, God reminded Ahaz through the prophet Isaiah that he had ample reason to trust God. The evidence? A future promise. In a moment where it would have made sense to the human mind to reference a past experience or previous fulfillment, God chose to offer hope with a word about something that had not yet happened. \\\\nThat future promise was the incarnation of Jesus Christ. God promised a Messiah would come in order to encourage Ahaz to trust the Lord in that moment. \\\\nIn hindsight, it is easy for us to read this and understand that God was forecasting a promise that we know He would ultimately keep. However, at the moment, this must have been perplexing to hear. \\\\nWhen we make our way through the New Testament and discover some of the beautiful and hopeful promises of the second return of Christ, the eternal joy of God\\\\u2019s people, and the faithfulness of God through trial and tribulation, we too might be tempted to wonder if it will actually happen. \\\\nNumbers 23:19 says, \\\\u201cGod is not a man, that he might lie, or a son of man, that he might change his mind. Does he speak and not act, or promise and not fulfill?\\\\u201d God is faithful. We can look to the past and find a record of this truth, which means we can look to the future with continued confidence. God is not a liar. \\\\nThough not overt, our faithlessness in the face of His future promises suggest that we at least think there may be a chance that He is not always true to His Word and faithful to fulfill His promises. Yet He will not waver, and we can set our faith in His faithfulness. \\\\nYes, be thankful for God\\\\u2019s faithfulness in the past, but also be confident in His future promises. God is present with us. He will not change His mind, His character, or His Word. \\\\n\\\\nNames to know\\\\nImmanuel: name meaning \\\\u201cGod with us.\\\\u201d Immanuel was the name of the son to be born in Isaiah\\\\u2019s prophecy to King Ahaz (Isa. 7:14) and fulfilled in the birth of Jesus (Matt. 1:22-23).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nGATHER Supplies\\\\nKeep a regular supply of the following items available at all times: Bibles, pens or pencils, markers, crayons, colored pencils, scissors, glue or tape, paper.\\\\nWELCOME\\\\nActivity Page\\\\n\\\\u201cGod\\\\u2019s Promised Sign\\\\u201d activity page\\\\nSession Starter (Option 1)\\\\nindex cards, 8\\\\nSession Starter (Option 2)\\\\nprint pictures of a pillar of cloud, pillar of fire, tabernacle, and temple\\\\nLEARN\\\\nIntroduce the Session\\\\ncountdown video\\\\nBig Picture Question\\\\nBig Picture Question Poster\\\\nReview the Timeline\\\\nGiant Timeline\\\\nTell the Bible Story\\\\n\\\\u201cGod Is Present with Us\\\\u201d video\\\\nBible Story Picture Poster\\\\nQuestions from Kids\\\\n\\\\u201cUnit 16, Session 4\\\\u201d questions from kids video\\\\nMissions Moment\\\\n\\\\u201cShahid and Maroofa Kamal Photo\\\\u201d printable\\\\nKey Passage Activity\\\\nKey Passage Poster\\\\n\\\\u201cThe Lord Your God (Zephaniah 3:17)\\\\u201d song\\\\nworship song of your choice (optional) \\\\nindex cards\\\\nLOVE\\\\nReview & Bible skills\\\\nSmall Group Timeline and Map Set\\\\nworld map\\\\nLIVE\\\\nActivity Choice (Option 1)\\\\ndry erase board\\\\ndry erase marker\\\\nActivity Choice (Option 2)\\\\nBig Picture Question Poster \\\\nJournal and Prayer\\\\nJournal Page\\\\n\\\\u201cGod Is With Us\\\\u201d activity page\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWELCOME\\\\nWELCOME Kids\\\\nGreet each kid as he or she arrives.

When he ruled over Judah, he did not do what was right. Ahaz made sacrifices and offerings to idols. Idols are people and things that are worshiped but are not the one true God. During Ahaz\\\\u2019s time as king, two other kings\\\\u2014the king of Israel and the king of Aram\\\\u2014agreed to protect each other in battles. King Ahaz gave silver and gold to the king of Assyria. Assyria was a strong nation, and the king of Assyria agreed to protect Judah. \\\\nOne day, Ahaz heard that the kings of Israel and Aram were coming to Judah. Their armies were going to attack Jerusalem! Ahaz was afraid! Everyone in Judah was afraid. \\\\nBut Ahaz didn\\\\u2019t need to be afraid. He should have trusted God. God had promised his ancestor, King David, that He would be with His people. God sent the prophet Isaiah to talk to Ahaz. Isaiah said, \\\\u201cPay attention and be quiet. Trust God. Be confident that God will take care of you.\\\\u201d \\\\nGod had good news for Ahaz. \\\\u201cThe kings of Israel and Syria are planning to attack Jerusalem and make someone else king. But this won\\\\u2019t happen,\\\\u201d God said. \\\\u201cIf you do not trust Me, you will not last.\\\\u201d \\\\nIsaiah said to Ahaz, \\\\u201cListen! God is going to give you a sign to prove He is telling the truth. Here is the sign: A virgin will have a baby. She will name the baby Immanuel.\\\\u201d \\\\nIsaiah told Ahaz that very soon, the kings of Israel and Syria would not be a threat to Judah. \\\\u201cBut,\\\\u201d Isaiah continued, \\\\u201cGod\\\\u2019s judgment is coming. He is going to judge you and the people of Judah. You have not seen judgment like this since Solomon\\\\u2019s kingdom was divided into Israel and Judah. The king of Assyria and his strong army is coming to attack! \\\\nOn that day, God will send enemy armies to Judah. The Assyrians will come from the north, and the Egyptians will come from the south. They will be everywhere, like flies and bees,\\\\u201d Isaiah said. \\\\u201cYou won\\\\u2019t be able to escape!\\\\u201d\\\\nChrist Connection: God is present with us. He sent prophets to His people, even in captivity, and promised to send Immanuel, which means \\\\u201cGod with us.\\\\u201d Jesus fulfilled this promise when He came to earth and was born of a virgin. Jesus is our Immanuel, God with us.  \\\\u2009\\\\nREVIEW THE BIBLE STORY\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002 Throughout Scripture, God proved that He could be trusted by His people. However, they didn\\\\u2019t always trust Him perfectly. Many times God\\\\u2019s people trusted Him when things were going well, but as soon as they encountered something that made them afraid, they doubted Him. King Ahaz reacted this way as well. Instead of trusting God would be with him, he reacted in fear. What was the sign God gave King Ahaz to remind him to trust God? [Allow responses.] God told Ahaz that He was going to send Immanuel\\\\u2014God with us.\\\\nDid God keep His promise? How? [Allow responses.] Jesus is Immanuel. Jesus was born hundreds of years after this promise. God became man and was born to save us from our sins. God has always desired to be with His people, but sin separated us from Him. When God became flesh in the person of Jesus, He made a way for us to be with Him. When we trust in Jesus as our Savior, we have the promise of God\\\\u2019s presence forever. \\\\u2009\\\\nChrist connection\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002\\\\u2009God is present with us.

God is in all places at all times and is always with His people.\\\\nChrist Connection: \\\\nGod is present with us. He sent prophets to His people, even in captivity, and promised to send Immanuel, which means \\\\u201cGod with us.\\\\u201d Jesus fulfilled this promise when He came to earth and was born of a virgin. Jesus is our Immanuel, God with us.\", \"leader\": \"Leader Bible Study\\\\nHave you ever heard someone say something along the lines of, \\\\u201cGod\\\\u2019s promise of the future should give you hope today\\\\u201d? Maybe you\\\\u2019ve heard it dozens of times or said it just as many. In part, this saying stands because we believe the Bible teaches this principle; however, at the gut level, this idea can be challenging to hear and believe. \\\\nIn Isaiah 7, God reminded Ahaz through the prophet Isaiah that he had ample reason to trust God. The evidence? A future promise. In a moment where it would have made sense to the human mind to reference a past experience or previous fulfillment, God chose to offer hope with a word about something that had not yet happened. \\\\nThat future promise was the incarnation of Jesus Christ. God promised a Messiah would come in order to encourage Ahaz to trust the Lord in that moment. \\\\nIn hindsight, it is easy for us to read this and understand that God was forecasting a promise that we know He would ultimately keep. However, at the moment, this must have been perplexing to hear. \\\\nWhen we make our way through the New Testament and discover some of the beautiful and hopeful promises of the second return of Christ, the eternal joy of God\\\\u2019s people, and the faithfulness of God through trial and tribulation, we too might be tempted to wonder if it will actually happen. \\\\nNumbers 23:19 says, \\\\u201cGod is not a man, that he might lie, or a son of man, that he might change his mind. Does he speak and not act, or promise and not fulfill?\\\\u201d God is faithful. We can look to the past and find a record of this truth, which means we can look to the future with continued confidence. God is not a liar. \\\\nThough not overt, our faithlessness in the face of His future promises suggest that we at least think there may be a chance that He is not always true to His Word and faithful to fulfill His promises. Yet He will not waver, and we can set our faith in His faithfulness. \\\\nYes, be thankful for God\\\\u2019s faithfulness in the past, but also be confident in His future promises. God is present with us. He will not change His mind, His character, or His Word. \\\\n\\\\nNames to know\\\\nImmanuel: name meaning \\\\u201cGod with us.\\\\u201d Immanuel was the name of the son to be born in Isaiah\\\\u2019s prophecy to King Ahaz (Isa. 7:14) and fulfilled in the birth of Jesus (Matt. 1:22-23).\", \"large_activities\": \"SESSION STARTER (10 minutes)\\\\nOption 1: Look It Up\\\\t \\\\nBefore the session, write the following references on index cards: Psalm 9:10; \\\\nPsalm 28:7; Psalm 31:14; Psalm 118:8; \\\\nProverbs 3:5-6; Isaiah 12:2; Isaiah 26:4.

It\\\\u2019s a word that means something different to each one of us. For some, rest brings to mind a desire to momentarily break from the chaos of life to sleep, relax, and even recover. For others, rest is an unrealistic hope as they navigate a non-stop schedule of busyness. Yet for others, the word rest suggests an uneventful, quiet life of the mundane.\\\\nWhether it\\\\u2019s a nap, a vacation, or boredom that comes to mind when you think of rest, it is likely a word that triggers some desire or response. And almost universally, the thought of rest is primarily physical.  \\\\nThe Bible teaches that rhythms of rest are good and necessary for us; however, the Bible\\\\u2019s primary teaching on rest refers to the spiritual. In Ezra 1, God\\\\u2019s remnant is instructed to recover from their exile with \\\\u2026 work.  \\\\nThis work would be costly, demanding, and long; but this work actually aimed to bring rest. How could this be so? Because their work was to build the place where they would encounter the living God, the One who gives true rest to the soul.  \\\\nIn Matthew 11:28-30, Jesus said, \\\\u201cCome to me, all of you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take up my yoke and learn from me, because I am lowly and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.\\\\u201d  \\\\nThough God clearly teaches us the benefits of a rhythm of physical rest\\\\u2014Sabbath\\\\u2014He ultimately uses physical rest to teach us of our need for a greater spiritual rest\\\\u2014a rest for our soul, a rest that comes in understanding that we cannot save ourselves. God has done everything necessary through Christ to save us. We are invited into this rest through the substitutionary atonement of Jesus.  \\\\nThe people of God are instructed in Ezra 1 to begin the arduous work of building God\\\\u2019s dwelling place. But this work would ultimately lead to their place of rest\\\\u2014in God\\\\u2019s presence.\\\\nWe too may find ourselves physically exhausted from the demanding work of faithfully following the Lord in the context He has placed us. But take heart, there is rest for your soul in the presence of God and the person of Christ. \\\\n\\\\nPeople TO KNOW\\\\nEzra: priest and scribe sent to Jerusalem by the king of Persia.

King Nebuchadnezzar had completely destroyed Jerusalem. Many of God\\\\u2019s people had died. Others lived in Babylon. Some of their children and grandchildren were born in Babylon and grew up there. But Babylon was not their home. \\\\nBefore God\\\\u2019s people were taken away from Judah, God promised through the prophet Jeremiah that the exile would last 70 years; then God would bring His people back to the land. At last, the time had come for God\\\\u2019s people to go home. \\\\nCyrus, king of Persia, had taken over Babylon. God gave Cyrus an idea. Cyrus made an announcement: \\\\u201cGod wants me to build Him a temple in Jerusalem, so let all of God\\\\u2019s people go back to Jerusalem so they can rebuild the Lord\\\\u2019s temple. Anyone who stays behind should give the travelers anything they need\\\\u2014gold and silver, animals, and gifts for God\\\\u2019s temple.\\\\u201d \\\\nThe exile was over! God\\\\u2019s people were free to go back to their homes. God\\\\u2019s promise was coming true. So the people got ready to go to Judah. All their neighbors helped them by giving them gifts: gold and silver, animals, and other expensive things. \\\\nKing Cyrus even brought out the dishes that King Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple in Jerusalem before he destroyed it. The king\\\\u2019s treasurer counted them: 30 gold basins; 1,000 silver basins; 29 silver knives; 30 gold bowls; 410 silver bowls; and 1,000 other pieces. In all, there were 5,400 pieces of gold and silver. \\\\nThe leader of God\\\\u2019s people\\\\u2014a man named Sheshbazzar (shesh BAZ uhr)\\\\u2014brought all these things along when the captives returned from Babylon to Jerusalem. \\\\nChrist Connection: God always keeps His promises.

Their exile to Babylon was meant to teach them to turn back to God and worship Him alone. But God promised that one day they would be free. \\\\nWho convinced King Cyrus of Persia to let God\\\\u2019s people return to Jerusalem? [Allow responses.] Look at Ezra 1:1. [Choose a volunteer to read aloud Ezra 1:1.] God moved King Cyrus\\\\u2019 heart. God kept His promise to return His people to Jerusalem after 70 years of exile.

[Choose a volunteer to read aloud Ezra 1:6-7.] God provided everything they would need to rebuild the temple! God not only can be trusted to keep His promises, but He can also be trusted to provide what \\\\nwe need. \\\\nGod\\\\u2019s great promise to save sinners also came true.

His parents had always been fascinated with East Asia, and they prayed when Hudson was just a newborn baby that he would someday work for God in China. \\\\nHudson spent his teenage years preparing to go to China by learning about medicine and studying Mandarin, a language spoken in China. He also spent time reading his Bible and praying. When Hudson arrived in Shanghai, he only stayed there for a few months before he and another man set off for other areas of China.

It\\\\u2019s a word that means something different to each one of us. For some, rest brings to mind a desire to momentarily break from the chaos of life to sleep, relax, and even recover. For others, rest is an unrealistic hope as they navigate a non-stop schedule of busyness. Yet for others, the word rest suggests an uneventful, quiet life of the mundane.\\\\nWhether it\\\\u2019s a nap, a vacation, or boredom that comes to mind when you think of rest, it is likely a word that triggers some desire or response. And almost universally, the thought of rest is primarily physical.  \\\\nThe Bible teaches that rhythms of rest are good and necessary for us; however, the Bible\\\\u2019s primary teaching on rest refers to the spiritual. In Ezra 1, God\\\\u2019s remnant is instructed to recover from their exile with \\\\u2026 work.  \\\\nThis work would be costly, demanding, and long; but this work actually aimed to bring rest. How could this be so? Because their work was to build the place where they would encounter the living God, the One who gives true rest to the soul.  \\\\nIn Matthew 11:28-30, Jesus said, \\\\u201cCome to me, all of you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take up my yoke and learn from me, because I am lowly and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.\\\\u201d  \\\\nThough God clearly teaches us the benefits of a rhythm of physical rest\\\\u2014Sabbath\\\\u2014He ultimately uses physical rest to teach us of our need for a greater spiritual rest\\\\u2014a rest for our soul, a rest that comes in understanding that we cannot save ourselves. God has done everything necessary through Christ to save us. We are invited into this rest through the substitutionary atonement of Jesus.  \\\\nThe people of God are instructed in Ezra 1 to begin the arduous work of building God\\\\u2019s dwelling place. But this work would ultimately lead to their place of rest\\\\u2014in God\\\\u2019s presence.\\\\nWe too may find ourselves physically exhausted from the demanding work of faithfully following the Lord in the context He has placed us. But take heart, there is rest for your soul in the presence of God and the person of Christ. \\\\n\\\\nPeople TO KNOW\\\\nEzra: priest and scribe sent to Jerusalem by the king of Persia.

They are used as ideas or desires that require work to achieve. They are used in the negative sense of not being a current reality. They are used as the aim, answer, or solution to the world\\\\u2019s problems.\\\\nThough the idea of peace and security are not foreign to our vernacular, they are most certainly foreign to much of our world\\\\u2019s reality. It is hard to find a pocket of the earth that might be described with these terms. Rather, what is most found is chaos and fear.  \\\\nWhen we understand the true impact of sin on the world, this comes as no surprise. It\\\\u2019s not shocking to see the news of war and violence. It does not bring amazement to hear of murder and strife. There is no astonishment at the experience of disappointment or pain because we know that we live in a world riddled with sin and its implications. \\\\nRead the words of Zechariah 14:11. What comes to mind? \\\\u201cPeople will live there, and never again will there be a curse of complete destruction. So Jerusalem will dwell in security.\\\\u201d\\\\nAre you struck by the thought of such a place that could be described as secure? Are you left longing for that to be your reality? Are you doubtful that this could ever be a reality? \\\\nUltimately, this is a promise that is sure to happen. This promise is reiterated in Deuteronomy 7:7-9:\\\\n\\\\u201cThe LORD had his heart set on you and chose you, not because you were more numerous than all peoples, for you were the fewest of all peoples. But because the LORD loved you and kept the oath he swore to your ancestors, he brought you out with a strong hand and redeemed you from the place of slavery, from the power of Pharaoh king of Egypt. Know that the LORD your God is God, the faithful God who keeps his gracious covenant loyalty for a thousand generations with those who love him and keep his commands.\\\\u201d \\\\nThis promise was for God\\\\u2019s people then, and it is for all who follow Jesus today as well.

God promised that He would remove the idols and set up a new kingdom with a new king. \\\\nSESSION STARTER (10 minutes)\\\\nOption 1: Hula Hoop Challenge        \\\\nForm two teams of kids. Guide each team to form a single line. Explain to kids that they will need to hold hands continuously while trying to pass the hula hoop down the line.

God\\\\u2019s people were home! A group had returned to Jerusalem to rebuild God\\\\u2019s temple. Zerubbabel the governor and Joshua the high priest led the people. They started the work, but their neighbors didn\\\\u2019t want them to rebuild the temple, so they stopped. \\\\nGod sent prophets to encourage His people to finish the temple and give them a message. One of those prophets was named Zechariah (ZEK uh RIGH uh). God told Zechariah what would happen in the future, and then Zechariah told the people what God said. \\\\nZechariah gave a message of hope. He shared what God would do for His people in the future. This is what Zechariah said: \\\\u201cA day is coming when the Lord will remove every idol from this land. No one will remember them or worship them.\\\\u201d God was going to set up a new kingdom over the nations. \\\\nZechariah said God would give His people a new king\\\\u2014like a shepherd caring for a flock of sheep. \\\\u201cThen God will say, \\\\u2018Sword, strike my shepherd,\\\\u2019 and the sheep will scatter. There will be troubles, but God will be doing something good,\\\\u201d Zechariah explained. \\\\nIn this new kingdom, God will judge and punish all evil. He will lead His own people back to Himself. Zechariah said, \\\\u201cThe people will call out to God, and He will answer them. He will say, \\\\u2018You are My people,\\\\u2019 and they will answer, \\\\u2018The LORD is our God.\\\\u2019\\\\u201d \\\\nThe new kingdom will have a new city\\\\u2014a New Jerusalem\\\\u2014that brings all the nations together and heals all of creation.\\\\nChrist Connection: Zechariah spoke a message of hope to God\\\\u2019s people. God would one day set up a new and better kingdom with a new and better King. God kept His promise by sending Jesus. Because of Jesus, we can have hope and forgiveness of sins by trusting in Him. \\\\u2009\\\\nREVIEW THE BIBLE STORY\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002 God kept His promise to send His people back to Jerusalem, but they still had a lot of work ahead of them. They still needed to rebuild the temple and make Jerusalem their home again. God also had an even bigger plan to restore the people\\\\u2019s relationship with Him forever.\\\\nWhat was God\\\\u2019s plan for the future? Look at Zechariah 13:1. [Choose a volunteer to read aloud Zechariah 13:1.] God had a plan to wash away the sin that separated people from Him. Jesus is the fountain whose blood was poured out to wash away our sin. Jesus paid the cost of our sin. Through faith in Jesus, we can be cleansed from our sin once and for all. \\\\nThe exiles who returned to Jerusalem faced troubles while rebuilding the temple. How did Zechariah\\\\u2019s message give them hope? Look at Zechariah 14:11. [Choose a volunteer to read aloud Zechariah 13:9.] Jerusalem was in utter destruction. The people\\\\u2019s sin had visible results. Zechariah\\\\u2019s message gave the people hope because God\\\\u2019s promise to wash away their sin also meant that God\\\\u2019s people would dwell in security. Not only would all things that are broken be made new, but they would be saved from the wrath of God. Jesus secures our future and offers us a way to be saved. \\\\u2009\\\\nChrist connection\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002\\\\u2009Zechariah spoke a message of hope to God\\\\u2019s people.

His church grew to 21 members. In 1861, he became very ill and went back to England to recover. While he was in England, Hudson continued translating the Bible into Chinese, as he had been doing while he was in China.

They are used as ideas or desires that require work to achieve. They are used in the negative sense of not being a current reality. They are used as the aim, answer, or solution to the world\\\\u2019s problems.\\\\nThough the idea of peace and security are not foreign to our vernacular, they are most certainly foreign to much of our world\\\\u2019s reality. It is hard to find a pocket of the earth that might be described with these terms. Rather, what is most found is chaos and fear.  \\\\nWhen we understand the true impact of sin on the world, this comes as no surprise. It\\\\u2019s not shocking to see the news of war and violence.

Yes, God cannot lie or ever be wrong, so we can trust whatever He has said.\\\\nChrist Connection: \\\\nGod\\\\u2019s people rebuilt the temple so they would have a place to worship God. Years later, God sent His Son, Jesus, to be with His people. Now, God does not dwell with His people through the temple. Instead, God dwells directly with His people through His Spirit. Jesus provided something better than the temple; He gives us Himself.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPREPARE\\\\nPrior TO TEACHING THE SESSION\\\\n\\\\nLeader Bible Study\\\\nImagine this for a moment: It\\\\u2019s late Saturday night, and you\\\\u2019ve been out of the house all day. You\\\\u2019ve gone from place to place, striving to complete more than seemed possible from your calendar to-do list. You\\\\u2019ve just returned home and sat down for dinner. Suddenly, you remember that tomorrow is Sunday. You quickly recall that you are scheduled to serve with preschoolers tomorrow morning, your small group is having lunch together after church, and you have yet to plan out this upcoming week. The thought crosses your mind, What if I just sat this one out tomorrow? \\\\nDoes this scenario hit close to home? \\\\nIn Ezra 3, as the work had begun to rebuild the temple, there was an eager desire among God\\\\u2019s people, leading them to anticipate what that place would afford them upon its completion. As the people worked and waited, even in the midst of their exhaustion, they made time to worship. \\\\nRead Ezra 3:6. Not only was the temple incomplete, but the first stage of the build was not yet done. Still, the laborers did not forget or fail to keep the purpose at the forefront of their minds. The goal was not the temple; it was the Lord. \\\\nWe often find ourselves in scenarios like the one above, ready to make excuses to not do the things that matter most because we\\\\u2019ve misplaced our priorities\\\\u2014or at least lost sight of them in the whirlwind of life. Our decisions reflect what has the seat of greatest importance in our lives. \\\\nHebrews 10:24-25 says, \\\\u201cAnd let us consider one another in order to provoke love and good works, not neglecting to gather together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging each other, and all the more as you see the day approaching.\\\\u201d \\\\nUnderstanding Christ to be our greatest purpose and prize ought to direct our paths toward prioritizing our lives around Christ and His church. Not only will this be good for us, but it will be good for the rest of God\\\\u2019s children as well. When we are eager to be with the Lord and His people, not only will we be productive, but we will be truly satisfied.\\\\nPeople TO KNOW \\\\nZerubbabel: grandson of King Jehoiachin.

His faithful love will last forever. Distribute paper and pencils to each kid.

First, the priests rebuilt the altar. They gave burnt offerings to God and celebrated. Then they laid the foundation of the temple. When the foundation was finished, the priests put on special clothes and the people praised God. They sang, \\\\u201cThe Lord is good. His faithful love will last forever.\\\\u201d \\\\nNot everyone was happy though. Some of the older people remembered what the temple had looked like before it had been destroyed. They cried and \\\\nshouted loudly. \\\\nSometimes other people interrupted the rebuilding of the temple by making the people of Judah discouraged or afraid. At one point, the building of the temple stopped for a while. God sent prophets to encourage the people, and they started working again. \\\\nAt this time, Darius (duh RIGH uhs), the king of Persia, ruled over the land of Judah. The king was in charge of a lot of land, so he put governors in charge of some of the land. A governor named Tattenai (TAT ih nigh) noticed what God\\\\u2019s people were doing. \\\\nTattenai asked the workers, \\\\u201cDo you have permission to rebuild this temple?\\\\u201d The workers said, \\\\u201cWe do.\\\\u201d Still, Tattenai sent a report to the king about what God\\\\u2019s people were doing. \\\\u201cThey said King Cyrus gave them permission to rebuild the temple,\\\\u201d Tattenai wrote. \\\\u201cPlease search the royal records to see if this is true.\\\\u201d \\\\nKing Darius\\\\u2019s officials searched the royal records for Cyrus\\\\u2019s order. They found it\\\\u2014a scroll with a record from King Cyrus. This is what was written on the scroll: \\\\u201cLet God\\\\u2019s temple be rebuilt. It will be a place to offer sacrifices. Let its foundation be rebuilt.\\\\u201d King Cyrus had also ordered for the cost of building the temple to be paid for out of the royal treasury. \\\\nSo King Darius sent a letter back to Tattenai. He gave this order: \\\\u201cStay away from the workers in Jerusalem. Don\\\\u2019t bother them or try to stop them. Give them whatever they need.\\\\u201d \\\\u2009\\\\nTattenai obeyed the king\\\\u2019s order. The Jewish leaders kept building, and they finally finished the temple of God! The people celebrated and made offerings to God. They chose priests and assistants to serve in the temple. Then God\\\\u2019s people celebrated the Passover. God\\\\u2019s people were so happy. Now the temple of God was finally complete.\\\\nChrist Connection: God\\\\u2019s people rebuilt the temple so they would have a place to worship God. Years later, God sent His Son, Jesus, to be with His people. Now, God does not dwell with His people through the temple. Instead, God dwells directly with His people through His Spirit. Jesus provided something better than the temple; He gives us Himself. \\\\nREVIEW THE BIBLE STORY\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002 The temple was the place the Jews worshiped God. It also represented God\\\\u2019s presence with His people. God\\\\u2019s plan for the people to rebuild the temple was meant to be a reminder that He was with them and that they should worship Him alone.\\\\nWhat did God\\\\u2019s people do first when they settled back in Jerusalem? Look at Ezra 3:2. [Choose a volunteer to read aloud Ezra 3:2.] God\\\\u2019s people rebuilt the altar first. They offered sacrifices for their sin and praised God. Then they laid the foundation of the temple. Some of the older people were sad that the temple did not look like the original. Even though the temple was different, God was still with His people. It was not how the temple looked that was important, but how God had continued to be faithful to His people. \\\\nWhy were the neighbors of God\\\\u2019s people unable to stop the rebuilding of the temple? [Allow responses.] God put a plan in place to provide for His people years before they would need it! God\\\\u2019s promise was put in writing by King Cyrus. Nothing can stop God\\\\u2019s words from coming true. Can God be trusted? Yes, God cannot lie or ever be wrong, so we can trust whatever He has said. \\\\u2009\\\\nChrist connection\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002\\\\u2009 God\\\\u2019s people rebuilt the temple so they would have a place to worship God.

Consider comparing the map to a modern-day map to help kids understand where this story took place. (Tip: Locate the areas in and around modern-day Israel.)\\\\n Choose a volunteer to read aloud Ezra 6:7,12.\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002 The neighbors wanted to stop the work of God\\\\u2019s people. They threatened and intimidated God\\\\u2019s people. They tried to stop the work by force and by law. But could God\\\\u2019s plans be stopped? [Allow responses.] No, God\\\\u2019s plans can never be stopped! The king\\\\u2019s decree to rebuild the temple came true because it was God\\\\u2019s plan all along. We can trust that God\\\\u2019s good plans for us through Jesus will also come true.

You\\\\u2019ve gone from place to place, striving to complete more than seemed possible from your calendar to-do list. You\\\\u2019ve just returned home and sat down for dinner. Suddenly, you remember that tomorrow is Sunday. You quickly recall that you are scheduled to serve with preschoolers tomorrow morning, your small group is having lunch together after church, and you have yet to plan out this upcoming week. The thought crosses your mind, What if I just sat this one out tomorrow? \\\\nDoes this scenario hit close to home? \\\\nIn Ezra 3, as the work had begun to rebuild the temple, there was an eager desire among God\\\\u2019s people, leading them to anticipate what that place would afford them upon its completion. As the people worked and waited, even in the midst of their exhaustion, they made time to worship. \\\\nRead Ezra 3:6. Not only was the temple incomplete, but the first stage of the build was not yet done. Still, the laborers did not forget or fail to keep the purpose at the forefront of their minds. The goal was not the temple; it was the Lord. \\\\nWe often find ourselves in scenarios like the one above, ready to make excuses to not do the things that matter most because we\\\\u2019ve misplaced our priorities\\\\u2014or at least lost sight of them in the whirlwind of life. Our decisions reflect what has the seat of greatest importance in our lives. \\\\nHebrews 10:24-25 says, \\\\u201cAnd let us consider one another in order to provoke love and good works, not neglecting to gather together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging each other, and all the more as you see the day approaching.\\\\u201d \\\\nUnderstanding Christ to be our greatest purpose and prize ought to direct our paths toward prioritizing our lives around Christ and His church.

Yes, God cannot lie or ever be wrong, so we can trust whatever He has said.\\\\nChrist Connection: \\\\nGod\\\\u2019s words brought hope to God\\\\u2019s people because His words were true. God can always be trusted. Jeremiah told about a day when God would forgive sin and change people\\\\u2019s hearts. Jesus\\\\u2019 death and resurrection provides forgiveness of sins. Through Jesus, we have new hearts and life with God forever.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPREPARE\\\\nPrior TO TEACHING THE SESSION\\\\n\\\\nLeader Bible Study\\\\nThere\\\\u2019s a strong likelihood that you have had to repeat a message to the same person multiple times, whether that person is a spouse, child, coworker, or friend. Some things are so important they are worth repeating. And some people are so quick to forget, we must repeat. \\\\nFor example, each of my four children have gone through seasons when brushing their teeth was such a chore that you would have thought they were being asked to eat nails. My wife and I would remind them dozens of times in the morning and dozens of times in the evening to brush their teeth, and yet still we would later find evidence that it didn\\\\u2019t happen. I feel confident none of them were belligerent in wanting their teeth to rot, but we were loving enough to remind them that this was likely to happen if they didn\\\\u2019t remember to complete this menial task a couple of times a day. \\\\nIn Jeremiah 31, there is a phrase that is repeated by the Lord to the hearer of these words. The phrase, \\\\u201cthe LORD\\\\u2019s declaration\\\\u201d occurs 10 times in these 40 verses. These words even appear at times in the middle of a thought or sentence, uniquely placed to garner great attention. In addition the phrase, \\\\u201cThis is what the Lord says\\\\u201d occurs seven times. Clearly, the Lord wants the hearers to be abundantly clear from whom these words are coming. \\\\nWe are most certainly forgetful people, often forgetting the smallest of details and even the most significant of facts. The Lord knows us on the deepest level and knows how great our need is for direct reminders. \\\\nJeremiah 31 contains difficult truths and delightful promises. God knows that the hearer is likely to bristle at the warnings and rejoice in the hope, but he also seemingly wants to ensure that we who read these words do not forget that they are His words. \\\\nAs we read the Bible, it is crucial that we recall the voice behind the words: the voice of God. Only God has the highest authority, holds all knowledge, and is perfectly good. Maybe you need to remember as you read and listen to God\\\\u2019s Word that this is the Lord\\\\u2019s declaration.\\\\n\\\\nDoctrine TO KNOW\\\\nGod is truthful: In God, there is no falsehood (Titus 1:2; Heb. 6:18).

He warned the people of God\\\\u2019s judgment because of their sin. But even though the people disobeyed, God had not abandoned them. His love never stopped, and God had a good plan for His people. \\\\nGod spoke through Jeremiah. This is what the Lord said: \\\\u201cOn the day when I restore My people to their land, I will be the God of all the families of Israel. They will be My people.\\\\u201d God\\\\u2019s people had been divided, but God was going to bring them back together. \\\\nThe people suffered in exile, but God said, \\\\u201cYou will make music again. You will dance with joy!\\\\u201d God was going to bring His people back home. He had scattered Israel, but He would gather them again. He would watch over them like a shepherd guards his flock. \\\\nGod said, \\\\u201cI will turn their mourning into joy, comfort them, and bring happiness out of grief. My people will be satisfied with My goodness.\\\\u201d \\\\nGod declared, \\\\u201cThere is hope for your future!\\\\u201d  \\\\nJeremiah told the people of Judah that God had a plan to change their hearts. God promised a new and better covenant so they could be saved from \\\\ntheir sins. \\\\nGod said that the new covenant would not be like the old covenant. In the old covenant, the people had God\\\\u2019s commands in writing. They disobeyed His commands and had to make sacrifices every year for their sin. In the new covenant, God was going to write His law on their hearts. That means He would give His people the power to obey His commands. God said, \\\\u201cI will forgive their wrongdoing and never again remember their sin.\\\\u201d\\\\nChrist Connection: God\\\\u2019s words brought hope to God\\\\u2019s people because His words were true. God can always be trusted. Jeremiah told about a day when God would forgive sin and change people\\\\u2019s hearts. Jesus\\\\u2019 death and resurrection provides forgiveness of sins.

The people of Judah ignored Jeremiah\\\\u2019s words and God punished their sin. The people of Judah were sad and afraid as they were taken away to Babylon. How did Jeremiah give the people hope? [Allow responses.] Jeremiah told the people that not only was God going to bring them back home to Judah, but He was also going to give them a way for their sins to be forgiven forever.\\\\nJeremiah told the people that God was going to give them a new covenant. What were some things Jeremiah said about the new covenant? [Allow responses.] God\\\\u2019s law was going to be written on hearts, it would wash away our sin forever, and it would help us obey Him. \\\\nHow did God fulfill His promise to give us a new covenant? [Allow responses.] God fulfilled this promise through Jesus! In Christ, we have the forgiveness of sins, new hearts that can love God rightly, and we are given the power to say \\\\u2018no\\\\u2019 to sin. God words will never fail and we can always trust Him. \\\\u2009\\\\nChrist connection\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002\\\\u2009God\\\\u2019s words brought hope to God\\\\u2019s people because His words were true.

God can always be trusted. Jeremiah told about a day when God would forgive sin and change people\\\\u2019s hearts. Jesus\\\\u2019 death and resurrection provides forgiveness of sins. Through Jesus, we have new hearts and life with God forever.\", \"leader\": \"Leader Bible Study\\\\nThere\\\\u2019s a strong likelihood that you have had to repeat a message to the same person multiple times, whether that person is a spouse, child, coworker, or friend. Some things are so important they are worth repeating. And some people are so quick to forget, we must repeat. \\\\nFor example, each of my four children have gone through seasons when brushing their teeth was such a chore that you would have thought they were being asked to eat nails. My wife and I would remind them dozens of times in the morning and dozens of times in the evening to brush their teeth, and yet still we would later find evidence that it didn\\\\u2019t happen. I feel confident none of them were belligerent in wanting their teeth to rot, but we were loving enough to remind them that this was likely to happen if they didn\\\\u2019t remember to complete this menial task a couple of times a day. \\\\nIn Jeremiah 31, there is a phrase that is repeated by the Lord to the hearer of these words. The phrase, \\\\u201cthe LORD\\\\u2019s declaration\\\\u201d occurs 10 times in these 40 verses. These words even appear at times in the middle of a thought or sentence, uniquely placed to garner great attention. In addition the phrase, \\\\u201cThis is what the Lord says\\\\u201d occurs seven times. Clearly, the Lord wants the hearers to be abundantly clear from whom these words are coming. \\\\nWe are most certainly forgetful people, often forgetting the smallest of details and even the most significant of facts. The Lord knows us on the deepest level and knows how great our need is for direct reminders. \\\\nJeremiah 31 contains difficult truths and delightful promises. God knows that the hearer is likely to bristle at the warnings and rejoice in the hope, but he also seemingly wants to ensure that we who read these words do not forget that they are His words. \\\\nAs we read the Bible, it is crucial that we recall the voice behind the words: the voice of God. Only God has the highest authority, holds all knowledge, and is perfectly good. Maybe you need to remember as you read and listen to God\\\\u2019s Word that this is the Lord\\\\u2019s declaration.\\\\n\\\\nDoctrine TO KNOW\\\\nGod is truthful: In God, there is no falsehood (Titus 1:2; Heb. 6:18).

All who believe in Jesus are rescued from sin and death.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPREPARE\\\\nPrior TO TEACHING THE SESSION\\\\n\\\\nLeader Bible Study\\\\nYou may never have said it aloud before, but there is a good chance that you have thought it: \\\\u201cIf I just had ________ [fill in the blank with your greatest desire], then following Jesus would be so much easier.\\\\u201d What is your greatest desire? For some it may be money; for others, possessions; for others, power or a relationship or a feeling. \\\\nWe live in a broken world and may often fantasize about what life would be like if our ideals came to pass. We may even hurt or mistreat others in pursuit of our dreams\\\\u2014to gain that which we believe has the greatest importance. But the reality is that even if we have all that we want, there is still a great temptation to desire more and continue seeking our own good at the expense of others. \\\\nHowever, we don\\\\u2019t find this temptation when we read about the life of Mordecai in the Book of Esther. We observe Mordecai\\\\u2019s journey from faithful adoptive father of a young girl in a foreign land to his becoming the king\\\\u2019s right-hand man. \\\\nMordecai was faithful. He was faithful to take in Esther, his cousin who was without father or mother. He was faithful to sit, wait, and watch every day at the gate of the king\\\\u2019s palace to see what God would do through this beautiful young woman. He was faithful to speak up with boldness and confidence, even at the threat of death. And he was faithful to lead beside the king in an honorable way seeking the flourishing of the kingdom. \\\\nMordecai rose to a position of great power and authority. Many figures in power tend to forget their roots, turning to selfishness and unfaithfulness. Mordecai, however, did not. Read Esther 10:3.\\\\nIn our temptation to seek our own pleasure, we must remember that our Savior, Jesus Christ, \\\\u201cdid not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many\\\\u201d (Mark 10:45). In remembering the work of Christ, we find not only an example to follow but also the power to do the same. \\\\nChrist in us seeks the good of those around us.

Many years earlier, when Cyrus was king, he sent some of God\\\\u2019s people back to Judah to rebuild the temple in Jerusalem. Another group of God\\\\u2019s people stayed in Persia. God\\\\u2019s people were called Jews because they were from Judah. The king of Persia chose Esther to be his queen. Esther didn\\\\u2019t tell the king that she was a Jew. \\\\nOne day, Mordecai heard that Haman, an important leader who worked for the king, was planning to kill all the Jews. Mordecai was upset! He was a Jew; he didn\\\\u2019t want all the people he loved to be killed. Mordecai and all the Jews cried. \\\\nEsther didn\\\\u2019t know what was wrong. She sent a messenger to ask Mordecai why all the Jews were upset. Mordecai told Esther about Haman\\\\u2019s evil plan. \\\\n\\\\u201cYou have to do something!\\\\u201d Mordecai said. \\\\u201cAsk the king to stop Haman. Ask him to save the Jewish people.\\\\u201d \\\\nEsther sent a message back to Mordecai. \\\\u201cNo one can approach the king unless the king calls for that person first,\\\\u201d Esther said. \\\\u201cThe punishment is death\\\\u2014unless the king holds out his scepter; then you may live.\\\\u201d \\\\n\\\\u201cYou\\\\u2019re a Jew,\\\\u201d Mordecai said. \\\\u201cIf you don\\\\u2019t stop Haman, he will kill you too. Maybe this is why you are the queen.\\\\u201d Maybe God put Esther in the palace to save her people! Esther asked Mordecai and the Jews to fast for three days. Then Esther would go to the king, even if it meant she might die. \\\\nOn the third day, Esther went to the king. He saw Esther and held out his golden scepter. \\\\u201cWhat is it, Queen Esther?\\\\u201d the king asked. \\\\u201cWhat do you want to ask me? I\\\\u2019ll give you anything\\\\u2014up to half of my kingdom.\\\\u201d \\\\nEsther said, \\\\u201cWould you and Haman come to a feast today?\\\\u201d \\\\nSo Haman and the king went to Esther\\\\u2019s feast.

I\\\\u2019ll give you anything\\\\u2014up to half of my kingdom.\\\\u201d \\\\n\\\\u201cCome to my feast tomorrow,\\\\u201d Esther said. \\\\nThe king agreed.

He punished Haman and made a law to keep the Jewish people safe from their enemies.\\\\nChrist Connection: God was in control over Haman\\\\u2019s evil plan to destroy the Jews. Like Haman, Satan wants to ruin God\\\\u2019s plan and destroy believers.

All who believe in Jesus are rescued from sin and death. \\\\nREVIEW THE BIBLE STORY\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002 God allowed Esther to be chosen as the queen. Did Esther tell the king that she was a Jew? Look at Esther 2:20. [Choose a volunteer to read aloud Esther 2:20.] Mordecai had instructed Esther not to reveal that she was a Jew. Some people in Persia did not like Jews. \\\\nWhen Mordecai heard of Haman\\\\u2019s plot against the Jews, Mordecai encouraged Esther to use her position as queen and speak to the king to help save her people. Haman\\\\u2019s evil plot was meant to destroy the Jewish nation. But what did Mordecai say would happen even if Esther kept silent about Haman\\\\u2019s evil plan? Look at Esther 4:13-14. [Choose a volunteer to read aloud Esther 4:13-14.] Mordecai was convinced that God would protect and rescue His people, even if Esther did not speak up about Haman\\\\u2019s plan. Still, Mordecai encouraged Esther to consider why she had been placed in the palace at this exact time. God placed Esther in her position as queen to protect His people. He continues to protect and rescue His people from the evil one who wants to destroy. God rescued His people then and He has rescued His people for all eternity through Jesus. \\\\u2009\\\\nChrist connection\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002\\\\u2009 God was in control over Haman\\\\u2019s evil plan to destroy the Jews.

Explain that for security purposes, you cannot name the specific country where David and Lark Washington (names changed) are serving as missionaries. \\\\nSAY\\\\u2002 David and Lark Washington are serving in a place where the country is in a state of unrest with the government. People who live there are afraid and confused. The missionaries have continued to tell people about Jesus through the difficult days in the country. \\\\nPlay the missions video. Explain that many businesses and churches in this country were closed for long periods of time. People who left the country were not allowed back into the country unless they stayed quarantined for two weeks in a government-run hospital when they returned. Some regions did not allow anyone who was not from the area to enter it. Help kids understand that missionaries had to find creative, new ways to continue telling people about Jesus. Tell kids that David was able to speak to several people as he read his Bible from on top of a ladder.\\\\nPray for the missionaries serving in Southeast Asia. Pray for their safety and wisdom as they continue serving God in difficult situations.\\\\nKey passage ACTIVITY (5 minutes)\\\\nBefore the session, use a dry erase board to write out the key passage but leave out several words.\\\\nShow the key passage poster.

For some it may be money; for others, possessions; for others, power or a relationship or a feeling. \\\\nWe live in a broken world and may often fantasize about what life would be like if our ideals came to pass. We may even hurt or mistreat others in pursuit of our dreams\\\\u2014to gain that which we believe has the greatest importance. But the reality is that even if we have all that we want, there is still a great temptation to desire more and continue seeking our own good at the expense of others. \\\\nHowever, we don\\\\u2019t find this temptation when we read about the life of Mordecai in the Book of Esther. We observe Mordecai\\\\u2019s journey from faithful adoptive father of a young girl in a foreign land to his becoming the king\\\\u2019s right-hand man. \\\\nMordecai was faithful. He was faithful to take in Esther, his cousin who was without father or mother. He was faithful to sit, wait, and watch every day at the gate of the king\\\\u2019s palace to see what God would do through this beautiful young woman. He was faithful to speak up with boldness and confidence, even at the threat of death. And he was faithful to lead beside the king in an honorable way seeking the flourishing of the kingdom. \\\\nMordecai rose to a position of great power and authority. Many figures in power tend to forget their roots, turning to selfishness and unfaithfulness. Mordecai, however, did not.

When we sin, we should feel sorry that we have disobeyed God and want to turn from our sin because we love Him.\\\\nChrist Connection: \\\\nNehemiah led the people to rebuild the walls around Jerusalem to protect them from their enemies. Jesus came to protect us from our greatest enemies, sin and death. He died on the cross and rose from the dead to rescue everyone who trusts in Him.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPREPARE\\\\nPrior TO TEACHING THE SESSION\\\\n\\\\nLeader Bible Study\\\\nRecall the last time you were faced with devastating news or found yourself filled with angst, worry, or fear. How did you respond? \\\\nAnger and bitterness are common reactions to bad news. We may feel tempted to isolate ourselves from others. Grief is complex, and responses vary greatly. However, according to the Bible, Nehemiah\\\\u2019s response is the best response. \\\\nWe read about Nehemiah\\\\u2019s general response in Nehemiah 1:4. Then in Nehemiah 1:5-11, we discover the specific way that Nehemiah prayed in response to this devastating news. He recognized God\\\\u2019s faithfulness, requested God\\\\u2019s ear, confessed sin, and committed his people to the Lord\\\\u2019s care. \\\\nNehemiah began his prayer with a recognition of the faithfulness of God. He indicated his confidence that God had been and would continue to be faithful. He then requested God\\\\u2019s ear. Though Nehemiah was confident that God heard him, he opened and closed his prayer of dependence by begging God to listen to his request.  \\\\nWhy did Nehemiah pray this way? Likely, he was further demonstrating his deep conviction that God and God alone is able to work in such a way that would bring about restoration. \\\\nNehemiah\\\\u2019s prayer also demonstrates his belief that sin has serious consequences. He confessed his own sin and the sin of his family, recognizing that God was fully aware of their sin, but also that this sin was not to be taken lightly and needed to be dealt with. \\\\nFinally, he committed his family\\\\u2014the Jewish people\\\\u2014into the hands of this faithful and just God. He trusted God to be faithful to His word and His people. Though Nehemiah didn\\\\u2019t know what the outcome would be, he was confident in his God, that He would remain faithful no matter what. \\\\nNehemiah\\\\u2019s response demonstrated a deep love, trust, and confidence in God that is exemplary for each of us. When we face moments of devastation, we can\\\\u2014with deep dependence\\\\u2014turn to God and find comfort.\\\\n\\\\nReturn from Exile\\\\nPhase 1 (538 BC): Temple rebuilt (Ezra 1\\\\u20136)\\\\nPhase 2 (458 BC): Leaders and judges returned (Ezra 7\\\\u201310)\\\\nPhase 3 (444 BC): Jerusalem rebuilt (Nehemiah 1\\\\u201313)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nGATHER Supplies\\\\nKeep a regular supply of the following items available at all times: Bibles, pens or pencils, markers, crayons, colored pencils, scissors, glue or tape, paper.\\\\nWELCOME\\\\nActivity Page\\\\n\\\\u201cRebuild the Wall\\\\u201d activity page\\\\nSession Starter (Option 1)\\\\noranges or balls, 1 per team\\\\nSession Starter (Option 2)\\\\nballs, 2-3\\\\nplastic cups, 10-20\\\\nLEARN\\\\nIntroduce the Session\\\\ncountdown video\\\\nBig Picture Question\\\\nBig Picture Question Poster\\\\nReview the Timeline\\\\nGiant Timeline\\\\nTell the Bible Story\\\\n\\\\u201cNehemiah Rebuilt the Walls\\\\u201d video\\\\nBible Story Picture Poster\\\\nOld Testament Mediterranean Map (optional)\\\\nstacking blocks or cups (optional)\\\\nQuestions from Kids\\\\n\\\\u201cUnit 18, Session 2\\\\u201d questions from kids video\\\\nKey Passage Activity\\\\nKey Passage Poster\\\\n\\\\u201cLead Us To Salvation (2 Corinthians 7:10)\\\\u201d song\\\\nworship song of your choice (optional)\\\\nindex cards\\\\nLOVE\\\\nReview & Bible skills\\\\nSmall Group Timeline and Map Set\\\\nworld map\\\\nLIVE\\\\nActivity Choice (Option 1)\\\\npink balloons, 10\\\\npurple balloons, 10\\\\nchairs or cones\\\\nbrooms, 1 per kid\\\\nActivity Choice (Option 2)\\\\nBig Picture Question Poster\\\\ndry erase board\\\\ndry erase marker\\\\nJournal and Prayer\\\\nJournal Page\\\\n\\\\u201cOrder the Events\\\\u201d activity page\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWELCOME\\\\nWELCOME Kids\\\\nGreet each kid as he or she arrives.

Then King Cyrus, the king of Persia, took over Babylon and let them go home. Some of God\\\\u2019s people went home to Judah, but some of them stayed in Babylon. Nehemiah (NEE huh MIGH uh) stayed and worked for the king of Persia. \\\\nOne day, some men came from Judah. Nehemiah asked, \\\\u201cHow are God\\\\u2019s people in Jerusalem?\\\\u201d The men had bad news: \\\\u201cThe people are in trouble. The walls around Jerusalem are broken down, and the gates are burned down.\\\\u201d \\\\nNehemiah sat down and cried. Then he spent time praying and fasting. The king noticed Nehemiah and asked, \\\\u201cWhat\\\\u2019s wrong? Why are you sad?\\\\u201d Nehemiah was afraid; no one was supposed to be sad around the king. Nehemiah said, \\\\u201cThe city where my ancestors are from is in ruins.\\\\u201d \\\\nThe king sent Nehemiah to Jerusalem. Nehemiah led the people to start rebuilding the walls and gates. The workers put in doors, bolts, and bars. They cut stones and lifted them into place on the wall, and they filled in gaps and holes. All around the city, people worked side by side. Soon the wall was half as tall as it had once been! \\\\nBut not everyone was happy that Jerusalem\\\\u2019s walls were being rebuilt. Some men who lived nearby made a plan to attack them and stop their work. God\\\\u2019s people prayed and chose men to guard the walls all day and all night, but the people were discouraged. \\\\nNehemiah reminded the people that God was with them. \\\\u201cDon\\\\u2019t be afraid,\\\\u201d he said. \\\\u201cGod is great and powerful! Be ready. If our enemies attack us, God will fight for us!\\\\u201d Enemies could threaten God\\\\u2019s people, but they could not make God\\\\u2019s people stop building. Their enemies were not in charge of rebuilding the wall; God was! \\\\nSo God\\\\u2019s people went back to work. Some stood guard with weapons, and others worked on the wall. Some men worked with one hand and held a weapon in the other. They were always ready to fight, just in case. \\\\nNehemiah was a wise and good leader for God\\\\u2019s people. In just 52 days, the wall was complete! The gates were repaired, and the wall was restored. The city was ready for more of God\\\\u2019s people to come home. When all of Jerusalem\\\\u2019s enemies heard that the wall had been rebuilt, they were afraid because they knew God was with His people.\\\\u2009\\\\nChrist Connection: Nehemiah led the people to rebuild the walls around Jerusalem to protect them from their enemies. Jesus came to protect us from our greatest enemies, sin and death. He died on the cross and rose from the dead to rescue everyone who trusts in Him. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nREVIEW THE BIBLE STORY\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002 When Nehemiah was overcome with sadness, what was the first thing He did? Look at Nehemiah 1:4. [Choose a volunteer to read aloud Nehemiah 1:4.] Nehemiah sought the Lord through prayer. As he prayed, he remembered who the Lord is; that He is the God who always keeps His promises and loves His people. Even in a time of great distress, Nehemiah knew the Lord was with His people and heard their cries.\\\\nThe enemies of God\\\\u2019s people taunted them because they did not like that they were rebuilding the wall. They even made plans to attack the wall, but God protected His people. How did God show that He was in control? Look at Nehemiah 4:15. [Choose a volunteer to read Nehemiah 4:15.] God frustrated the plans of their enemies. This means that God made it so the enemies\\\\u2019 wicked plans would not happen.  \\\\nEventually, Nehemiah and the people completed the wall. When their enemies saw that they had completed this task, how did they respond? Look at Nehemiah 6:16. [Choose a volunteer to read aloud Nehemiah 6:16.] They saw that the work was completed with the help of the one true God. \\\\nIf we have received Jesus as Savior, God has completed the work of salvation for us. God sent His Son, Jesus, to conquer sin and death and to save those who receive Him as Lord. \\\\u2009\\\\nChrist connection\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002\\\\u2009Nehemiah led the people to rebuild the walls around Jerusalem to protect them from their enemies.

Since COVID-19 has slowed down the pace of life in the area, many people make more time to listen and talk about God with others.  \\\\nTell the kids that Stephen and Erin Spencer met an elderly lady in a Southeast Asia village. Explain that the lady wondered if the Bible stories she heard were true. Tell the kids that she said to her family, \\\\u201cThere might be something to this living God they\\\\u2019re talking about.\\\\u201d Tell kids that one day, not long after she made that statement, the woman\\\\u2019s daughter came in to tell her that their pig had died. \\\\nSAY\\\\u2002 In this area, a pig can be sold for income that a family can live on for two to three months. The daughter asked, \\\\u2018Is there anything this \\\\u2018living God\\\\u2019 can do?\\\\u2019 The elderly lady went to the pigpen, where a crowd from the village had gathered. She crawled into the pigpen, got on her knees, and said, \\\\u2018God, if You\\\\u2019re real, then show these people that You\\\\u2019re real.\\\\u2019 While she was praying, the dead pig stood up. The woman believed in God, and she was baptized the next day. Many people have believed in Jesus after seeing the answered prayers of this elderly lady in the village. \\\\nPray, asking God to help the new believers grow in their faith and continue to tell other people in their village about Jesus.\\\\nKey passage ACTIVITY (5 minutes)\\\\nBefore the session, write out the key passage on index cards, writing only one word on each card. Create several sets depending on the size of your group. \\\\nSAY\\\\u2002\\\\u2009What is \\\\u2018godly grief\\\\u2019? [Allow kids to respond.] Godly grief means that we are genuinely sorry for our sin because it is an eternal offense against God.

(Tip: Locate the areas in and around modern-day Jerusalem [H5].) \\\\nChoose a volunteer to read aloud Nehemiah 1:5-9. \\\\nSAY\\\\u2002 Nehemiah showed godly grief when he prayed to God. His sorrow over his own sin and the sin of his people caused him to seek repentance. He recognized that the destruction of Jerusalem was because God\\\\u2019s people had sinned. Nehemiah\\\\u2019s godly grief and repentance led him to right action. He trusted in God\\\\u2019s Word and remembered God\\\\u2019s promises. Nehemiah believed that one day God would dwell with His people. Because of his faith in God, he obediently acted to rebuild Jerusalem\\\\u2019s wall. \\\\u2009\\\\nGROUP DISCUSSION (10 minutes)\\\\nAsk the following questions. Lead the group to discuss.\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002 What can we learn from Nehemiah\\\\u2019s prayer in Nehemiah 1:4-11?  \\\\u2009\\\\nLead kids to understand that Nehemiah\\\\u2019s prayer praised God and His character, confessed sin, recounted God\\\\u2019s promises, and asked God for help. Help kids understand that there are no special words we have to pray, but that the Bible does help us know how to pray.\\\\n(Option: Choose a volunteer to read Matt. 6:9-13.)\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002 Does trusting God mean we always just sit back and wait? Why not? \\\\u2009\\\\nHelp kids understand that Nehemiah trusted the Lord to accomplish the rebuilding of the wall, but he didn\\\\u2019t sit back and do nothing. Remind kids that faith calls us to act upon what we believe.

Remind kids that God did what we could not do by sending Jesus to live a perfect life for us.

We also learned that God answered a woman\\\\u2019s prayer and raised a pig to life. God not only has the power to save pigs from dying, but He has the power to save people from sin and death too. Missionaries want to give people the hope of Jesus so they can be saved to live with God forever. \\\\nOption 2: Praying Scripture      \\\\nDistribute paper, pens or pencils, and a Bible to each kid. Encourage kids that praying does not have to be difficult and they do not have to have the perfect words to say while they pray.

Some examples may include Psalm 19:14; Psalm 25:4; Psalm 27:1; Isaiah 25:1; Hebrews 13:6; and Ephesians 2:10. Choose to add your own as well. Challenge kids to look up and read one of the verses, turn that Scripture into a prayer, and write the prayer on their papers.\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002 In our story today, we learned that Nehemiah prayed Scripture. Praying Scripture helps keep our minds focused on truth and it reveals sin. It also causes our hearts to be moved to love God so that we desire to turn away from sin.  \\\\n\", \"header\": \"UNIT 18  |  SESSION 2\\\\nNehemiah Rebuilt the Walls\\\\nNehemiah 1\\\\u20137\\\\nKey Passage:\\\\n2 Corinthians 7:10\\\\nBig Picture Question:\\\\nHow should we feel when we sin?

How did you respond? \\\\nAnger and bitterness are common reactions to bad news. We may feel tempted to isolate ourselves from others. Grief is complex, and responses vary greatly. However, according to the Bible, Nehemiah\\\\u2019s response is the best response. \\\\nWe read about Nehemiah\\\\u2019s general response in Nehemiah 1:4. Then in Nehemiah 1:5-11, we discover the specific way that Nehemiah prayed in response to this devastating news. He recognized God\\\\u2019s faithfulness, requested God\\\\u2019s ear, confessed sin, and committed his people to the Lord\\\\u2019s care. \\\\nNehemiah began his prayer with a recognition of the faithfulness of God. He indicated his confidence that God had been and would continue to be faithful. He then requested God\\\\u2019s ear. Though Nehemiah was confident that God heard him, he opened and closed his prayer of dependence by begging God to listen to his request.  \\\\nWhy did Nehemiah pray this way? Likely, he was further demonstrating his deep conviction that God and God alone is able to work in such a way that would bring about restoration. \\\\nNehemiah\\\\u2019s prayer also demonstrates his belief that sin has serious consequences. He confessed his own sin and the sin of his family, recognizing that God was fully aware of their sin, but also that this sin was not to be taken lightly and needed to be dealt with. \\\\nFinally, he committed his family\\\\u2014the Jewish people\\\\u2014into the hands of this faithful and just God. He trusted God to be faithful to His word and His people. Though Nehemiah didn\\\\u2019t know what the outcome would be, he was confident in his God, that He would remain faithful no matter what. \\\\nNehemiah\\\\u2019s response demonstrated a deep love, trust, and confidence in God that is exemplary for each of us.

When we sin, we should feel sorry that we have disobeyed God and want to turn from our sin because we love Him.\\\\nChrist Connection: \\\\nGod\\\\u2019s Word is powerful. When Ezra read God\\\\u2019s Word, the people loved God more and changed their ways. The Bible says that Jesus is \\\\u201cthe Word.\\\\u201d Jesus is God who came to live with people on earth. Jesus has the power to change our hearts.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPREPARE\\\\nPrior TO TEACHING THE SESSION\\\\n\\\\nLeader Bible Study\\\\nFind 1 John 1:9 in your Bible and read it slowly two or three times. Many Christians are familiar with these words; perhaps you have them memorized. We agree that God wants us to confess our sins to Him. We believe that God is faithful to forgive His children by the blood of Jesus. But do you find it easy to confess your sin to God? If not, why? Do you believe the lie that keeping quiet about our sin will prevent God from knowing about it? \\\\nIn Ezra 9, leaders approached Ezra and declared to him the grim reality of the people of Israel who were caught up in devious behavior and lifestyles. Following the second return of exiles to Jerusalem, the men of Israel began to intermarry with foreign women again. It was as if they had completely forgotten God. Ezra\\\\u2019s response of honest confession before a holy God ought to teach us something about his character and about our need to do likewise. \\\\nFirst, Ezra stood before God and the faithful of Israel, and he cried out before the Lord. Ezra didn\\\\u2019t point fingers as he went before God. He didn\\\\u2019t shift the blame or use the chance to gossip about others in his community. Ezra did precisely what we see later recorded in 1 John 1:9: he confessed his sin to God. \\\\nEzra truly believed that it was right to bring his sin and the sin of his community before God, to lay it all out before the Lord and to seek God\\\\u2019s forgiveness by faith and repentance. And not only did Ezra see the good of confession, he found reason to celebrate as he did.  \\\\nRead Ezra 9:13. Ezra recognized the necessity of confession and then celebrated that God\\\\u2019s grace was still enough, still active, and still effective toward His people. \\\\nEzra took his sin seriously and confessed it before a holy God. And Ezra confessed with hope that the God he had sinned against, had been gracious and would continue to be so.  \\\\nWhen we bring our sin before God, let us do so with humility rooted in our deep need for God and confidence grounded in our understanding of His amazing grace.\\\\n\\\\nTERMS TO KNOW \\\\nConfession: admission, declaration, or acknowledgment; a significant element in the worship of God.

[Distribute Bibles to any kid who does not have one.]   \\\\nWhen we meet together, we read God\\\\u2019s Word and seek to understand it. We should rejoice that God has been so kind to give His Word and to help us understand how His Word leads us to know Jesus. We should read God\\\\u2019s Word every day. Today, we will learn about a man named Ezra who read God\\\\u2019s Word to the people in Jerusalem.

How should we feel about sin? When we sin, we should feel sorry that we have disobeyed God and want to turn from our sin because we love Him.  \\\\nGod is kind to show us our sin. If we were really sick, we would want a doctor to give us the right diagnosis so we could then get the right treatment. God has told us that we sin so that we can turn to Jesus and be saved. In our story today, we will see how God\\\\u2019s Word showed God\\\\u2019s people their sin and how the people responded. God\\\\u2019s Word is powerful. God uses His Word to show us our sinfulness, but He also uses His Word to change our hearts and allow us to experience forgiveness of our sin through Jesus. \\\\u2009\\\\u2009\\\\nReview the timeline (1 minute)\\\\nShow the giant timeline.

God placed Esther in a position of power to protect His people from destruction. God also protected Nehemiah and the others as they rebuilt the wall around Jerusalem. Through it all, though, the people of God continued to battle with sin. \\\\nGod\\\\u2019s protection and faithfulness was shown to Israel, not because they deserved it, but because of God\\\\u2019s covenant faithfulness. God was working to remind His people of their need of Him. He had promised that by faith in His future promise of a Messiah, they would find forgiveness. Today, we will see how God used His Word to show the people their sin and draw them back to Him. \\\\u2009\\\\u2009\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLEARN the Bible Story\\\\nTELL THE BIBLE STORY: VIDEO OR STORYTELLER (10 minutes)\\\\nOpen your Bible to Ezra 7\\\\u201310; Nehemiah 8.

With God\\\\u2019s help, the people finished rebuilding the walls and the city gates in just 52 days. Ezra (EZ ruh), a priest and scribe, had traveled from Babylon to Jerusalem with a group of God\\\\u2019s people. God was with Ezra, and Ezra wanted to study God\\\\u2019s law, obey it, and teach it to God\\\\u2019s people. \\\\nEzra met with some of the people of Israel. He learned that some of the people and their leaders had disobeyed God, ignoring His Word. Ezra tore his clothes and pulled out some of his hair. He sat down and was very upset. Ezra got on his knees and prayed to God, confessing the people\\\\u2019s sin. As he did this, God\\\\u2019s people began to gather around him. They cried too and offered sacrifices, promising to be faithful to God. \\\\nSeveral years later, the people in Jerusalem gathered together early in the morning at one of Jerusalem\\\\u2019s gates. Men, women, and children\\\\u2014anyone who could understand\\\\u2014came to listen to the reading of God\\\\u2019s Word. As the sun was just coming up, Ezra brought out the book of the law of Moses that God had given to His people. God\\\\u2019s words were written on a scroll. Ezra stood on a high wooden platform and began to read. \\\\nEzra read the law for hours, and all the people listened carefully. The people stood up; they had respect for God\\\\u2019s Word. Ezra praised God, and the people lifted up their hands. \\\\n\\\\u201cAmen! Amen!\\\\u201d they said. The people in the crowd bowed down with their faces to the ground, and they worshiped God. \\\\nSome of the leaders there\\\\u2014the Levites (LEE vights)\\\\u2014explained the law to the people and helped them understand the words Ezra read. As the people heard the words of the law, they began to cry. The law was God\\\\u2019s rules for living, and the people had disobeyed God. They realized they had sinned. \\\\nEzra, the Levites, and Nehemiah (NEE huh MIGH uh) the governor said, \\\\u201cThis day is holy to the Lord your God. Do not be sad or cry.\\\\u201d Even though the people\\\\u2019s sin made them sad, this was a happy day. \\\\nThen Ezra said to them, \\\\u201cGo home and prepare a feast! Eat rich food and drink sweet drinks. Share what you have prepared with those who have nothing prepared.\\\\u201d\\\\u2009 \\\\nThe people obeyed Ezra. They prepared a feast. They were glad because they understood the words of the law that were explained to them. \\\\nChrist Connection: God\\\\u2019s Word is powerful. When Ezra read God\\\\u2019s Word, the people loved God more and changed their ways. The Bible says that Jesus is \\\\u201cthe Word.\\\\u201d Jesus is God who came to live with people on earth. Jesus has the power to change our hearts. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nREVIEW THE BIBLE STORY\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002 God\\\\u2019s Word is powerful. Our story showed us how God used His Word to change the hearts of His people as Ezra taught the Scriptures. What made Ezra a good communicator of God\\\\u2019s Word? Look at Ezra 7:10. [Choose a volunteer to read aloud Ezra 7:10.] The Bible tells us that Ezra didn\\\\u2019t simply read God\\\\u2019s law to the people, but that Ezra spent time studying God\\\\u2019s Word and letting it change his heart. Ezra did not just tell the people what they should be doing, but he himself followed God\\\\u2019s law, then he taught God\\\\u2019s Word to the people. \\\\nAfter the people heard the law, what did Ezra tell them to do? Look at Ezra 10:11. [Choose a volunteer to read aloud Ezra 10:11.] God had convicted His people of their sin through the His Word. The people responded by being sorry for their sin, but Ezra encouraged them to go one step further by confessing their sins to the Lord and turning from their sinful ways. \\\\nWhen we sin against the Lord, we should be sorry for our sin and want to turn from our sin. Let\\\\u2019s say our big picture question and answer. How should we feel about sin? When we sin, we should feel sorry that we have disobeyed God and want to turn from our sin because we love Him. Through Jesus\\\\u2019 death and resurrection, we can experience freedom from sin and from the punishment sin requires. \\\\u2009\\\\nChrist connection\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002\\\\u2009God\\\\u2019s Word is powerful.

People in the village did not believe she would live much longer. The elderly lady asked the woman\\\\u2019s husband if she could pray for God to heal her. The husband agreed to let her pray for healing. The elderly woman told the man\\\\u2019s wife about Jesus and prayed for her. In 10 minutes, the woman who had been paralyzed and in pain was able to sit upright in a chair. The next day, the woman walked out of her house and met Stephen and Erin. The healed lady believed in Jesus and became \\\\na Christian.   \\\\nPlay the missions video. Then, close in prayer, asking God that more people in the village will believe in Jesus.

Consider comparing the Old Testament Kingdoms Map to a modern-day map to help kids understand where these stories took place. (Tip: Locate the areas in and around modern-day Jerusalem.)\\\\nChoose a volunteer to read aloud Ezra 9:6,9.\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002 Ezra recognized the grievousness of his sins and the people\\\\u2019s sins. He was so overwhelmed by how great their sin was that he could not even lift his face. Ezra recognized that sin is an eternal offense against an eternal, holy God. The guilt of sin is higher than the heavens. \\\\nBut Ezra also remembered the grace of God. Even though the people had not been faithful to the Lord or obeyed His commands, God was still faithful. He was still showing them steadfast love and protection. Like Ezra, we should be sorry for our sin and repent. Then, we should also remember that God has shown us steadfast love by sending Jesus to rescue us from sin and death. \\\\u2009\\\\nGROUP DISCUSSION (10 minutes)\\\\nAsk the following questions.

Many Christians are familiar with these words; perhaps you have them memorized. We agree that God wants us to confess our sins to Him. We believe that God is faithful to forgive His children by the blood of Jesus. But do you find it easy to confess your sin to God? If not, why? Do you believe the lie that keeping quiet about our sin will prevent God from knowing about it? \\\\nIn Ezra 9, leaders approached Ezra and declared to him the grim reality of the people of Israel who were caught up in devious behavior and lifestyles. Following the second return of exiles to Jerusalem, the men of Israel began to intermarry with foreign women again. It was as if they had completely forgotten God. Ezra\\\\u2019s response of honest confession before a holy God ought to teach us something about his character and about our need to do likewise. \\\\nFirst, Ezra stood before God and the faithful of Israel, and he cried out before the Lord. Ezra didn\\\\u2019t point fingers as he went before God. He didn\\\\u2019t shift the blame or use the chance to gossip about others in his community. Ezra did precisely what we see later recorded in 1 John 1:9: he confessed his sin to God. \\\\nEzra truly believed that it was right to bring his sin and the sin of his community before God, to lay it all out before the Lord and to seek God\\\\u2019s forgiveness by faith and repentance. And not only did Ezra see the good of confession, he found reason to celebrate as he did.  \\\\nRead Ezra 9:13. Ezra recognized the necessity of confession and then celebrated that God\\\\u2019s grace was still enough, still active, and still effective toward His people. \\\\nEzra took his sin seriously and confessed it before a holy God. And Ezra confessed with hope that the God he had sinned against, had been gracious and would continue to be so.  \\\\nWhen we bring our sin before God, let us do so with humility rooted in our deep need for God and confidence grounded in our understanding of His amazing grace.\\\\n\\\\nTERMS TO KNOW \\\\nConfession: admission, declaration, or acknowledgment; a significant element in the worship of God.

Do you think of sadness? Weeping and guilt? Shame and failure? What about worship? \\\\nWhen was the last time you came before God in true confession? What led to your admission of failure before a holy God? \\\\nThe Bible is clear that \\\\u201cGod\\\\u2019s kindness is intended to lead you to repentance\\\\u201d (Rom. 2:4). But what does the Bible say about what confession should look like? What does the Bible say should lead us to confession? \\\\nNehemiah 9 gives insight in how to answer that question. God\\\\u2019s people had gathered and were fasting and beginning to confess their sin when the priests chimed in with an appropriate pattern for how that confession ought to progress. \\\\nIn this text, we discover that true confession of sin will never come before genuine recognition of the holiness of God. God\\\\u2019s people had promised to be faithful, but following their return from exile, the men of Israel intermarried with foreign women. They were unfaithful to God, disobeying His commands. Yet God remained faithful. \\\\nThe pattern of the priests is to first recognize, exclaim, and celebrate God\\\\u2019s goodness, faithfulness, holiness, and righteousness. Only out of those comes the reason for confession. For it is only when we see the majesty of the holy God that we see the weight of our sin and the punishment due to us as a result. Then, and only then, will we be drawn to the altar of honest confession before God.

But God is always faithful to His promises. In our Bible story today, we will learn how God was faithful to His people even when they broke their promises to be faithful to Him. \\\\nSESSION STARTER (10 minutes)\\\\nOption 1: Remember            \\\\nForm groups of three or four kids. Provide each group with a piece of paper and a pencil. Challenge each group to recall as many Old Testament Bible stories as they can and write them on the piece of paper in five minutes.

Lead kids to think about ways the people\\\\u2019s disobedience didn\\\\u2019t stop God from being faithful to them.\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002\\\\u2009God\\\\u2019s people (and we) have never been able to faithfully obey Him. But that never stopped God from continuing to be faithful. God cannot be anything but faithful because His faithfulness is directly tied to His character and truthfulness.

[Allow kids to respond.] Our big picture question and answer is, How should we feel when we sin? When we sin, we should feel sorry that we have disobeyed God and want to turn from our sin because we \\\\nlove Him.  \\\\nToday, we will see how God uses His Word to show us our sin and our need for a Savior\\\\u2014Jesus. God\\\\u2019s people responded to His faithfulness by confessing their sin and promising to be faithful to Him. They were sorry for their sin and wanted to turn away from sin and turn to God. \\\\u2009\\\\u2009\\\\nReview the timeline (1 minute)\\\\nShow the giant timeline.

Nehemiah led God\\\\u2019s people in Jerusalem to repent and confess their sin. To show they were sorry for their sin, the people fasted. They wore sackcloth and put dust on their heads. They spent time reading and listening to God\\\\u2019s Word, confessing their sin, and worshiping the Lord. \\\\nLeaders stood and led God\\\\u2019s people in prayer: \\\\u201cBlessed be the LORD your God forever and ever,\\\\u201d they prayed. \\\\u201cYou, LORD, are the only God. You created the heavens and the earth and all that is on it, the seas and all that is in them. You give life to all of them, and all the stars of heaven worship You.\\\\u201d \\\\nThey remembered everything God had done in Israel\\\\u2019s past, praying, \\\\u201cYou chose Abram and changed his name to Abraham. You made a covenant with him and gave him the promised land. You kept Your promise, for You are righteous.\\\\u201d \\\\nThey also remembered how God had seen the Israelites\\\\u2019 suffering in Egypt and delivered them, dividing the Red Sea for them to cross. He led them with a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night. He gave them His law on Mount Sinai. He gave them bread and water in the wilderness. But the people had turned away from God. They worshiped idols and did not trust Him. Yet God was forgiving, gracious, and compassionate. He did not abandon them. \\\\nIn their praise to God, they also remembered how God gave His people kingdoms and multiplied them. They were successful and happy. But the people turned away from God. The people thought back to when God sent prophets to warn them, but they did not listen. God let their enemies take over, but He did not destroy or abandon them because God is gracious and compassionate. \\\\nThe leaders prayed, \\\\u201cNow today we are slaves in the land You gave our ancestors. We need help! So we promise to be faithful and worship only You.\\\\u201d The people agreed to follow God\\\\u2019s law. \\\\nThen the leaders and some of the people stayed in Jerusalem, and everyone else went to live in the cities nearby.\\\\nChrist Connection: God\\\\u2019s people remembered all He had done and promised to be faithful. God is gracious and compassionate. All along, God has been faithful to people who are unfaithful. We experience God\\\\u2019s grace and compassion in Jesus, who gave His life so we can receive mercy and life forever. \\\\u2009\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nREVIEW THE BIBLE STORY\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002 God\\\\u2019s people had a constant struggle with sin. They disobeyed God\\\\u2019s law and worshiped false gods. But God remained faithful to His people. God\\\\u2019s people often had to suffer the consequences of their sins, but God always heard their cries and was gracious toward them.\\\\nAfter reading God\\\\u2019s law, what did God\\\\u2019s people do? Look at Nehemiah 9:3. [Choose a volunteer to read aloud Nehemiah 9:3.] After the people read and heard God\\\\u2019s law, they realized the seriousness of their sin and confessed it to the Lord. They also responded by crying out to the Lord and worshiping Him for His faithfulness and mercy. \\\\nSometimes the sins of God\\\\u2019s people caused them to suffer. Was God being unfair or unkind in causing His people to fall into the hand of their enemies because of their disobedience? Look at Nehemiah 9:33. [Choose a volunteer to read aloud Nehemiah 9:33.] No! God is righteous. This means He always does what is right and good. And God was faithful even when His people disobeyed. Sin has consequences, but God, because of His great mercy and grace, provides a way for His people to be forgiven. He provided a way for His people to be delivered from their enemies and He provided a way for us to be saved from sin and death through His Son, Jesus. \\\\u2009\\\\nChrist connection\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002\\\\u2009God\\\\u2019s people remembered all He had done and promised to be faithful. God is gracious and compassionate. All along, God has been faithful to people who are unfaithful.

How has God been faithful to you?\\\\u2009\\\\u2009\\\\nMissions moment (3 minutes) \\\\nDisplay a world map and point to the area of Southeast Asia. Emphasize that sometimes missionaries face difficult situations in the places they serve, but they continue their work and trust God to help them. Point out that during the pandemic and government unrest, many missionaries serving in Southeast Asia could not leave their areas because they would be required to quarantine for two weeks in a government-run hospital when they returned. Other people also could not come into the areas. Explain that this meant many missionaries did not have anyone visit them or have the freedom to leave for over a year and a half.\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002 During these difficult days, missionaries were still faithful to share the gospel with the people of Southeast Asia. We can also be faithful to share the gospel when we face hard times. God can use an illness or a tragedy to help others see the hope of the gospel. \\\\nPray for missionaries around the world who are facing challenging times. Ask God to help them trust Him and hope in His promise to one day make all things new.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nKey passage ACTIVITY (5 minutes)\\\\nBefore the session, write each word of the key passage on a sticky note. Then place the sticky notes around the room.\\\\nShow the key passage poster. Lead kids in reading aloud 2 Corinthians 7:10 together.\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002\\\\u2009Our key passage talks about salvation. From what does Jesus save us? [Allow kids to respond.] Jesus saves us from sin and death and gives us new life in Him.  \\\\u2009\\\\u2009\\\\nChallenge kids to find all the sticky notes and work together to place them in order on a wall in front of the room as quickly as they can. Repeat as time allows and see if the group can beat their first time. If you have a large group, consider forming kids into smaller groups. \\\\nLead kids to sing \\\\u201cLead Us To Salvation (2 Corinthians 7:10).\\\\u201d You may also choose to sing a worship song of your choice.\\\\nPray (2 minutes)\\\\nInvite kids to pray before transitioning to Love.\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002\\\\u2009Thank You, God, for Your faithfulness toward us.

Guide kids to open their Bibles to Nehemiah 9. Remind kids that God had been with Nehemiah to rebuild the wall around Jerusalem and that Nehemiah was now the governor. Explain that the priest Ezra was also present with Nehemiah to read the law and teach it to the people. \\\\nConsider comparing the Old Testament Kingdoms Map to a modern-day map to help kids understand where these stories took place. (Tip: Locate the areas in and around modern-day Jerusalem [H5].) \\\\nChoose a volunteer to read aloud Nehemiah 9:17.\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002 Through the reading of God\\\\u2019s Word, the people felt sorry for their sin. The people confessed their sin, and God heard the people\\\\u2019s cries for forgiveness. The people\\\\u2019s unfaithfulness to God was a sin, but God never stopped loving or caring for His people. He is faithful and always stands ready \\\\nto forgive.  \\\\nGod displayed His faithfulness and love toward us by sending Jesus to take the punishment our sin demands. Reading God\\\\u2019s Word helps us to understand that we should feel sorry for our sin, repent, and turn to Jesus. When we place faith in Jesus, we do not receive the punishment we deserve. Instead, we receive the gift of eternal life.  \\\\u2009\\\\nGROUP DISCUSSION (10 minutes)\\\\nAsk the following questions. Lead the group to discuss.\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002 How does remembering God\\\\u2019s faithfulness help us when we sin?  \\\\u2009\\\\nHelp kids understand that if we are saved by faith in Jesus, we can trust that God will be faithful to His promise to wash away our sin.

But what does the Bible say about what confession should look like? What does the Bible say should lead us to confession? \\\\nNehemiah 9 gives insight in how to answer that question. God\\\\u2019s people had gathered and were fasting and beginning to confess their sin when the priests chimed in with an appropriate pattern for how that confession ought to progress. \\\\nIn this text, we discover that true confession of sin will never come before genuine recognition of the holiness of God. God\\\\u2019s people had promised to be faithful, but following their return from exile, the men of Israel intermarried with foreign women. They were unfaithful to God, disobeying His commands. Yet God remained faithful. \\\\nThe pattern of the priests is to first recognize, exclaim, and celebrate God\\\\u2019s goodness, faithfulness, holiness, and righteousness. Only out of those comes the reason for confession. For it is only when we see the majesty of the holy God that we see the weight of our sin and the punishment due to us as a result.

Or it may lead to a place of genuine confession and repentance followed by a deep trust in the power of God to help us walk in freedom. \\\\nRomans 8 provides for us a warning against living according to the flesh, but it also declares a promise that we can cling to in our battle against sin. \\\\nRomans 8:8-9 says, \\\\u201cThose who are in the flesh cannot please God.

Form kids into two equal teams. For a large group, create several equal sized teams and play multiple rounds of tug of war. \\\\nPlace a team on each side of the rope. Place an adult leader by the center of the rope. At the signal, direct teams to work together and pull as hard as they can to try to get the bandana to cross where the adult leader is standing. The team that does this first, wins. \\\\n(Safety tip: Play this game on a soft surface.)\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002\\\\u2009The struggle with sin can be a lot like this game of tug of war. But the good news is that because of Jesus, we no longer have to be controlled by sin. In today\\\\u2019s Bible story, we will learn how Jesus sets us free from the power of sin.  \\\\nOption 2: Put off, Put On\\\\nPlace two piles of new T-shirts on one side of the room and place two piles of old shirts on the other side. Form kids into two or more equal sized teams and direct them to line up one behind the other. \\\\nChallenge kids to race to put on the old T-shirt, run across the room, take off the old T-shirt, put on the new T-shirt, and race back to their team to tag the next kid. Continue playing until one team is the first to have all kids complete the race.  \\\\nSAY\\\\u2002 When we feel sorry for our sin, we recognize that we need forgiveness. But we also need to be made new and be given a heart that wants to live for God. In today\\\\u2019s Bible story, we will learn how new life in Jesus gives us the power to put off our old sinful desires and walk in new desires that help us live \\\\nfor God. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLEARN\\\\nTHE STORY OF THE GOSPEL\\\\n\\\\nINTRODUCE the Bible Story\\\\nIntroduce the session (3 minutes)\\\\nShow the countdown video as you transition to introduce the Bible story. Set it to end as the session begins.\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002\\\\u2009Welcome kids! I\\\\u2019m so glad you\\\\u2019re here today! My name is [your name], and today we are going to study a story from the Bible together. If you brought your Bibles today, will you hold them up? [Distribute Bibles to kids who need one.] \\\\nHave you ever had to apologize for something you did? How did it make you feel to apologize? [Allow kids to respond.] Sometimes saying \\\\u2018I\\\\u2019m sorry\\\\u2019 is hard, but it\\\\u2019s important that we recognize how we have sinned against God and against others. God\\\\u2019s Word tells us that we should be sorry when we sin, that we should confess our sin, and then turn away from sin. God is faithful to forgive us when we confess sin and place faith in Jesus.\\\\nToday\\\\u2019s Bible story takes us to the New Testament as we read from the Book of Romans. Romans was a letter written by the apostle Paul to the church in Rome. God used Paul to share important truths about how Christians are to live because of what Jesus has done for us. \\\\u2009\\\\nBig picture question (1 minute)\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002\\\\u2009Let\\\\u2019s recite our big truth question and answer together. How should we feel when we sin? When we sin, we should feel sorry that we have disobeyed God and want to turn from our sin because we love Him. \\\\nToday, our Bible story will help us learn that those who follow Jesus want to live differently. Because of God\\\\u2019s great mercy shown to us through Jesus, we have new hearts that want to obey God and not let sin rule over us. This doesn\\\\u2019t mean we won\\\\u2019t sin, but it does mean we ask God to help us turn from our sin because we love Him. \\\\u2009\\\\u2009\\\\nReview the timeline (1 minute)\\\\nShow the giant timeline. Point to individual Bible stories as you review.\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002\\\\u2009The Bible reminds us over and over again that people are not able to perfectly obey God and remain faithful to Him. But God remained faithful. He kept His promises and sent Jesus to obey the law perfectly for us. We cannot earn salvation, but if we believe in Jesus and all He has done for us, we can be saved from our sin. Today\\\\u2019s Bible story teaches us that Jesus not only saves us from the death sin brings, but also saves us to live rightly for God now. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2009\\\\u2009\\\\nLEARN the Bible Story\\\\nTELL THE BIBLE STORY: VIDEO OR STORYTELLER (10 minutes)\\\\nOpen your Bible to Romans 8. Use the Bible storytelling tips to help you tell the story, or show the Bible story video \\\\u201cWe Should Be Sorry for Sin.\\\\u201d Use the bold text to retell or review the story.\\\\nWe Should Be Sorry for Sin\\\\n \\\\u2009 Over and over in the Old Testament, God\\\\u2019s people promised to be faithful. God gave His law to show what He requires, but again and again, the people failed to obey perfectly. They rebelled and turned against God. Even when they wanted to obey God, they could never be good enough\\\\u2014no matter how hard they tried! Their sin made them guilty before God. They needed help. They needed a Savior. \\\\nAt just the right time, God kept His promise to send a Savior. Jesus came to rescue sinners. Sin is powerful, but Jesus is more powerful. A believer named Paul wrote about sin in a letter to Christians in Rome. Paul said that Jesus was the Savior the people had been waiting for. \\\\nThis is what Paul said: \\\\u201cNow there is no condemnation\\\\u2014no judgment or punishment\\\\u2014for those who have been saved by faith in Jesus. Why? Because the new law\\\\u2014the law of the Spirit\\\\u2014has set you free from the old law. The old law was written down, and it helped you understand that you are a sinner. The old law brought sin and death. God sent Jesus to defeat sin and death so that we could be made righteous by faith in Him and live through the Spirit. God has put the new law in our hearts. The new law brings life and peace.\\\\u201d \\\\nSo Paul talked about two ways of living: living by doing what our sinful self wants or living by doing what God wants. Since Jesus frees us from the power of sin, we can say no to sin. God gives us His Spirit and power to live in a way that honors God.  \\\\nPaul wanted to be clear: Being not guilty before God doesn\\\\u2019t mean we should keep on sinning. God\\\\u2019s Spirit in us gives us power to turn away from sin and obey God. When we let the Spirit lead us, we prove to be children of God. \\\\nGod doesn\\\\u2019t just change something in us; He changes us. God gives us a new heart\\\\u2014new desires and a new way of thinking. This is a miraculous gift from God. We still struggle with sin, but now what is most true about us is not that we are sinners but that we belong to Jesus.\\\\nChrist Connection: God sent Jesus to take the punishment our sin deserves. Because of Jesus, we have forgiveness of sins and eternal life. Through God\\\\u2019s Spirit, we have the power to turn away from sin and live to bring glory to God. \\\\u2009\\\\nREVIEW THE BIBLE STORY\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002 Paul begins Romans 8 with some amazing news! There is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. What does it mean that we no longer have condemnation? [Allow responses.] It means that those who have trusted in Jesus no longer face the punishment sin deserves but instead have been found innocent. Jesus perfectly obeyed God\\\\u2019s law and took our punishment for us when He died on the cross. \\\\nWhat does Romans 8:11 say? [Ask a volunteer to read Romans 8:11 and allow responses.] Paul reminds us that by faith in Jesus, His Spirit now lives in us and brings us new life. This is an important truth in the life of the believer because now we have the power to say no to sin. Because of what Jesus has done for us, the Spirit not only gives us new life but also helps us fight against sin.\\\\nWhat are the two ways of living Paul wrote about? [Ask a volunteer to read Romans 8: 13.] We can either live by following our sinful desires or live by the Spirit. If we live by obeying our sinful desires, then we will die. But if we live by the Spirit, and fight against sin by obeying God\\\\u2019s Word, we will live. Only Jesus can set us free from the law of sin and death. \\\\u2009\\\\nChrist connection\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002\\\\u2009God sent Jesus to take the punishment our sin deserves. Because of Jesus, we have forgiveness of sins and eternal life. Through God\\\\u2019s Spirit, we have the power to turn away from sin and live to bring glory to God.  \\\\u2009\\\\u2009\\\\n(Tip: Use Scripture and the Gospel Plan Poster to explain how to become a Christian.

Tell kids that Stephen and Erin Spencer continue to check on the elderly lady from the Southeast Asia village. Remind kids that many people believed in Jesus when they saw miracles happen as the elderly lady prayed.\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002 We can thank God and praise Him for the way He has led people to believe in Jesus through the sharing of His Word and the prayers said. But there are still many people who need to know the hope of Jesus. Many people are without hope because of government unrest and they believe in many gods instead of the one true God. \\\\nLead the kids in prayer, asking that God will continue to help the Washingtons and Spencers as they work in Southeast Asia. Pray for the elderly lady and other believers as they continue to tell other people in the village about Jesus.\\\\nKey passage ACTIVITY (5 minutes)\\\\nShow the key passage poster.

(Tip: Locate the areas in and around modern-day Rome [B1].) \\\\nChoose a volunteer to read aloud Romans 8:9.\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002 God spoke through Paul to teach us that if we have accepted Jesus as Savior, we no longer live under the power and control of sin. Rather, we live under the power of the Spirit. We have the power, through the Spirit, to say no to sin and choose to live according to what God says is right.  \\\\nWhen we experience true grief over our sin and turn to God in repentance, we get to experience the freedom and joy of living for the Lord.

Why not? \\\\u2009\\\\nHelp kids understand that until Jesus returns, we will continue to fight against sin.
