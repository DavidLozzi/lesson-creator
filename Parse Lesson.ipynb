Now, God does not dwell with His people through the temple. Instead, God dwells directly with His people through His Spirit. Jesus provided something better than the temple; He gives us Himself.\n",

      "Imagine this for a moment: It’s late Saturday night, and you’ve been out of the house all day. You’ve gone from place to place, striving to complete more than seemed possible from your calendar to-do list. You’ve just returned home and sat down for dinner. Suddenly, you remember that tomorrow is Sunday. You quickly recall that you are scheduled to serve with preschoolers tomorrow morning, your small group is having lunch together after church, and you have yet to plan out this upcoming week. The thought crosses your mind, What if I just sat this one out tomorrow? \n",
      "Does this scenario hit close to home? \n",
      "In Ezra 3, as the work had begun to rebuild the temple, there was an eager desire among God’s people, leading them to anticipate what that place would afford them upon its completion. As the people worked and waited, even in the midst of their exhaustion, they made time to worship. \n",
      "Read Ezra 3:6. Not only was the temple incomplete, but the first stage of the build was not yet done. Still, the laborers did not forget or fail to keep the purpose at the forefront of their minds. The goal was not the temple; it was the Lord. \n",
      "We often find ourselves in scenarios like the one above, ready to make excuses to not do the things that matter most because we’ve misplaced our priorities—or at least lost sight of them in the whirlwind of life. Our decisions reflect what has the seat of greatest importance in our lives. \n",
      "Hebrews 10:24-25 says, “And let us consider one another in order to provoke love and good works, not neglecting to gather together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging each other, and all the more as you see the day approaching.” \n",
      "Understanding Christ to be our greatest purpose and prize ought to direct our paths toward prioritizing our lives around Christ and His church. Not only will this be good for us, but it will be good for the rest of God’s children as well. When we are eager to be with the Lord and His people, not only will we be productive, but we will be truly satisfied.\n",

      "Option 1: start and stop       \n",
      "Use a dry erase board to write, The Lord is good. His faithful love will last forever. Distribute paper and pencils to each kid. Lead the kids to look at the dry erase board and read the message aloud.  \n",
      "Explain to the kids that they will need to copy the message as quickly and as legibly as they can in 30 seconds. Tell kids that when you say “start” they may begin writing but that when you say “stop”, they must pause writing. Continue saying “start” and “stop” throughout the 30 seconds. Ask kids if any of them could complete the message in 30 seconds. As time allows, challenge kids with this activity multiple times.\n",
      "SAY  Was it frustrating to continue to be interrupted while trying to complete the message? Sometimes we can become upset or discouraged when things do not go as we had hoped. In our Bible story today, God’s people needed to be encouraged to trust God even when things weren’t going as they hoped. \n",
      "Option 2: Search Royal Records\n",
      "Create 20 scrolls using paper and yarn. Choose one scroll and write the words, “Let God’s temple be rebuilt” on the inside. \n",
      "Scatter the scrolls on the floor. Lead kids to untie the yarn and unravel the scrolls in search of the scroll with the message. Invite the kid who finds the message to read \n",
      "it aloud.  \n",
      "SAY  In today’s Bible story, the king’s officials searched the royal records to prove that God’s people were allowed to rebuild the temple in Jerusalem. God keeps His promises and His words will never fail. Through our Bible story, we will be reminded that we can always trust God because He never lies or is wrong.\n",

[Hold up Bible.] We can trust everything we read in the Bible because it is God’s Word, and God cannot lie. Who brought their Bibles with them this morning? [Distribute Bibles to those who don’t have one.]\n",
      "Our Bible story today is found in the Book of Ezra. Is Ezra in the Old or New Testament? [Allow responses.] Yes, it is an Old Testament book. We can find it in our Bible after 2 Chronicles and before Nehemiah. An important message in Ezra is the reminder for God’s people to return to right worship of God. One way God encouraged the people toward right worship was through the rebuilding of the temple.\n",

      "Big picture question (1 minute)\n",
      "SAY  Can God be trusted? [Allow kids to respond.] Yes, God cannot lie or ever be wrong, so we can trust whatever He has said. Sometimes we can be tempted to not trust God when our circumstances are difficult. If we have hard things happening in our life, we might wonder if God knows what He is doing. In the Old Testament, God’s people reacted this way sometimes. But God can never lie or be wrong. We can trust that even when times are hard, God is working to show us that what we need most is Jesus. Knowing Jesus gives us hope in hard times and helps us remember that He came to undo all the horribleness of sin.  \n",

      "Show the giant timeline. Point to individual Bible stories as you review.\n",
      "SAY  God’s people disobeyed God and worshiped idols. God judged their sin and sent them into exile. But God promised that after 70 years, He would set them free. Just like God promised, His people went home to Jerusalem after 70 years in exile. But the city of Jerusalem was in ruins. God sent prophets like Zechariah to encourage God’s people and give them hope while they rebuilt the temple. Let’s read our Bible story to learn if the temple was completed.\n",

      "Choose a volunteer to read 1 Thess. 5:16-18.\n",
      "\n",
      "SAY  Why is Jesus a better gift than a temple?  \n",
      "Emphasize how a temple was a temporary reminder of God’s presence with His people. Remind kids that God sent Jesus to die for our sins and raise to life so that we can have forgiveness, life forever, and the promise of the Holy Spirit. Lead kids to understand that unlike a temple, which can only be in one place, God is with us always through His Spirit.\n",
      "Choose a volunteer to read Matt. 12:6.\n",
      "\n",
      "SAY  How should we respond when others might tempt us to disobey God?  \n",
      "Guide kids to discuss how the Jews had a choice to continue to follow God’s plan and rebuild the temple or listen to those who tried to stop them. Remind kids that following Jesus is better because He leads us to life and forgiveness. Encourage kids that they can pray and God will be with them to give them courage.\n",

      "Option 1: Fingers Out \t \n",
      "Pair kids with a partner. Lead each partner to face each other. Direct kids to hold up one fist. Explain that you will say, “ready, set, go” and that on “go” each partner must extend any number of fingers while simultaneously shouting out a number from 0–10. Kids may choose to display the number zero by keeping a closed fist. Lead kids to count the sum of the fingers extended. The kid from each pair who shouted the number closest to the sum of the fingers gets a point. Play until a kid from each pair earns five points. \n",
      "SAY  Fingers out is a traditional Chinese game played by children in China. It is important for missionaries to learn about the cultures of the people they serve and to find ways to build relationships with the people. Hudson Taylor not only learned the Mandarin language, but he also took time to learn the customs of the Chinese as well.  \n",
      "Option 2: Write a Praise Song\t   \n",
      "Prompt kids to form groups of four to six kids. Distribute a piece of paper and a pencil to each group. Challenge kids to write a praise song including the sentences, The Lord is good. His faithful love will last forever. Encourage kids to think of different music styles they might use to make their worship songs. Guide kids to look at the psalms for examples. Encourage kids to take turns sharing their praise songs with the class.\n",
      "SAY  Like God’s people in today’s Bible story, we can sing songs to God to thank Him for keeping His word. No matter what situation we face, God is always worthy of praise. We can praise God for His faithfulness and trustworthiness. Can God be trusted? Yes, God cannot lie or ever be wrong, so we can trust whatever He has said.\n",

God is in all places at all times and is always with His people.\\\\nChrist Connection: \\\\nGod did not abandon His people. The prophet Jeremiah encouraged God\\\\u2019s people. He said God was going to save His people from captivity and raise up a new King\\\\u2014a forever King\\\\u2014from David\\\\u2019s family.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPREPARE\\\\nPrior TO TEACHING THE SESSION\\\\n\\\\nLeader Bible Study\\\\nGod\\\\u2019s Word is living, active, sharp, powerful, and profitable. (Heb. 4:12; 2 Tim. 3:16-17) The Bible indicates that by the power of the Holy Spirit, God\\\\u2019s words teach, rebuke, correct, and train us so that we are complete and equipped for the work that God has created us for. The Bible is full of stories, illustrations, commands, warnings, and heart-provoking questions that provide for us everything we need.\\\\nYet, throughout our lives, we intentionally disregard God\\\\u2019s words for us. We are guilty of the same thing that Jeremiah 29:19 describes\\\\u2014not listening to God\\\\u2019s words. \\\\nWhen we know God\\\\u2019s words and know that God\\\\u2019s words are good for us, why do we continuously neglect them? The answer is simple: We prefer our own way. \\\\nThroughout the Bible, God warns us by direct command and historical example. We find explicit instructions to obey God\\\\u2019s words and explicit assurances of the pending consequences for refusing to obey His words. We find instances where God executes His justice on those unknowingly ignorant toward His instructions and those blatantly defiant toward Him. God takes His words seriously and expects that we do the same. \\\\nWhat is your relationship to God\\\\u2019s words given to us in the Bible? Are you distant, aware, knowledgeable, or in awe? Are you dismissive, forgetful, interested, or obedient? God\\\\u2019s expectation is that we would hear and obey His words, that we would seek His truth and live His truth, and that we would know His instructions and heed them. \\\\nThe reality is that we all will fail to do this, but there is hope because of the One who has the title \\\\u201cThe Word.\\\\u201d Jesus, the living Word of God, lived a perfect life in full obedience to God and His words, yet He died the death that we deserve so that in our failure, we might find hope. \\\\nThe answer to our struggle to listen and obey God\\\\u2019s words is not simply trying harder, but pursuing a greater love of God, a greater hope in His Son, and a greater trust in His Spirit. These will lead us to greater obedience. His expectations are great, but His mercy is more.\\\\nPeople to know\\\\nJeremiah: prophet who proclaimed God\\\\u2019s judgment upon Judah and Jerusalem and proclaimed hope and salvation.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nGATHER Supplies\\\\nKeep a regular supply of the following items available at all times: Bibles, pens or pencils, markers, crayons, colored pencils, scissors, glue or tape, paper.\\\\nWELCOME\\\\nActivity Page\\\\n\\\\u201cGod Is Faithful Maze\\\\u201d activity page\\\\nSession Starter (Option 2)\\\\nindex cards, 4\\\\nLEARN\\\\nIntroduce the Session\\\\ncountdown video\\\\nBig Picture Question\\\\nBig Picture Question Poster\\\\nReview the Timeline\\\\nGiant Timeline\\\\nTell the Bible Story\\\\n\\\\u201cJeremiah Encouraged God\\\\u2019s People\\\\u201d video\\\\nBible Story Picture Poster\\\\nQuestions from Kids\\\\n\\\\u201cUnit 16, Session 1\\\\u201d questions from kids video\\\\nMissions Moment\\\\n\\\\u201cPartner with Send Vancouver\\\\u201d missions video\\\\nmap of Canada or the world\\\\nKey Passage Activity\\\\nKey Passage Poster\\\\n\\\\u201cThe Lord Your God (Zephaniah 3:17)\\\\u201d song\\\\nworship song of your choice (optional)\\\\npool noodle (optional)\\\\nindex cards, 1 per kid\\\\nLOVE\\\\nReview & Bible Skills\\\\nSmall Group Timeline and Map Set\\\\nworld map\\\\nLIVE\\\\nActivity Choice (Option 1)\\\\nplay dough\\\\nActivity Choice (Option 2)\\\\nBig Picture Question Poster\\\\nsmall cups, 15\\\\nrubber bands, 1 per kid\\\\npermanent marker\\\\nJournal and Prayer\\\\nJournal Page\\\\n\\\\u201cBible Story Review\\\\u201d activity page\\\\nWELCOME\\\\nWELCOME Kids\\\\nGreet each kid as he or she arrives. Use this time to collect the offering, fill out attendance sheets, build relationships, and help new kids connect to your group.\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002Has someone ever encouraged you in some way? How were you encouraged? Who encouraged you? What did you do in response? \\\\nActivity page (5 minutes)\\\\nInvite kids to complete \\\\u201cGod Is Faithful Maze\\\\u201d on the activity page.\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002What message did you find? God made a promise to His people. Do you think God kept His promise? Today, we\\\\u2019ll hear a story about the prophet Jeremiah. Jeremiah spoke God\\\\u2019s message to His people. Jeremiah encouraged God\\\\u2019s people. Let\\\\u2019s get ready to learn more. \\\\nSESSION STARTER (10 minutes)\\\\nOption 1: Pass the Message\\\\t \\\\nGuide kids to form two single-file lines. Whisper an important message to the first kid in each line. Sample messages:\\\\nTomorrow morning at 8:30, the bus will depart from 415 Newberry Street.\\\\nToday at 11:15, we will serve grilled cheese and pickles with chips for lunch.\\\\nIn four minutes, call 555-8909.\\\\nChallenge the players to whisper the message to the next player in line until the message reaches the end. Invite the last players to say the message aloud. The first team to get the message accurately to the end of the line wins. Play again, using a different message, as time allows.\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002That was fun to deliver those messages quickly. In the Bible, God gave important messages to prophets who then shared those messages to God\\\\u2019s people. Today, we\\\\u2019ll hear about a message the prophet Jeremiah shared with God\\\\u2019s people. \\\\nOption 2: What Would You Say?\\\\nBefore the session, write the following scenarios on index cards:\\\\nTake cover! A tornado is coming your way! \\\\nDon\\\\u2019t eat that sandwich! It\\\\u2019s full of dirt!\\\\nBe careful! That plate is hot and will burn you! \\\\nDon\\\\u2019t get in the ocean! There\\\\u2019s a shark! \\\\nForm four groups and distribute the scenario cards. Instruct each group to read the scenario and take turns acting out how they would respond to the warning.\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002If someone gave you one of these warnings, what would you do? Would you listen, or would you ignore it? Today, we\\\\u2019re going to see how God sent prophets to warn His people. We\\\\u2019ll find out how the people responded. Do you think they listened? \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLEARN\\\\nTHE STORY OF THE GOSPEL\\\\n\\\\nINTRODUCE the Bible Story\\\\nIntroduce the session (3 minutes)\\\\nShow the countdown video as you transition to introduce the Bible story. Set it to end as the session begins.\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002Hi, everyone! My name is [your name]. I\\\\u2019m excited you\\\\u2019re here with us today. Did anyone bring their Bible today? Hold up your Bible if you brought it. [Distribute Bibles to kids who need one.]\\\\nThe Bible is God\\\\u2019s Word. It is one Book with many stories, all fitting together to tell one bigger story. That story is the gospel\\\\u2014the good news of how God saves sinners through His Son, Jesus. One important part to understand in the gospel story is sin. In today\\\\u2019s story, we\\\\u2019re going to see how the sinful ways of God\\\\u2019s people brought trouble to them, but God\\\\u2014in His grace and love for them\\\\u2014sent an encouraging message through the prophet Jeremiah. \\\\u2009\\\\nBig picture question (1 minute)\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002Our big picture question for today and the next few weeks is, Where is God? That\\\\u2019s a great question. How would you answer if someone asked you that? [Allow kids to respond.] The answer we\\\\u2019ll memorize is this: God is in all places at all times and is always with His people. Let\\\\u2019s say that together: Where is God? God is in all places at all times and is always with His people.\\\\nCan you think of a time when God\\\\u2019s people wondered where God was and then He provided for them in some way? Think about the stories we\\\\u2019ve learned about in the Bible. When things got tough for God\\\\u2019s people, they often wondered where God was. Every time, He was still there. And today, He is still with His people. \\\\u2009\\\\u2009\\\\nReview the timeline (1 minute)\\\\nShow the giant timeline. Point to individual Bible stories as you review.\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002Remember that every story in the Bible is part of God\\\\u2019s big story. Over the last few weeks, we have seen how God\\\\u2019s people were taken captive in Babylon. The people were far away from the land God had given them, but they were not far from the God who had given it. \\\\nIn the stories we will hear, we will learn how even in exile, God was with His people watching over them. He promised them that one day, they would return to the land, and when they did, they would return to Him as well. Today\\\\u2019s story is called \\\\u2018Jeremiah Encouraged God\\\\u2019s People.\\\\u2019 Let\\\\u2019s see where it fits on the timeline.

Use the Bible storytelling tips to help you tell the story, or show the Bible story video \\\\u201cJeremiah Encouraged God\\\\u2019s People.\\\\u201d Use the bold text to retell or review the story.\\\\nJeremiah Encouraged God\\\\u2019s People\\\\nThe Northern Kingdom of Israel had turned from God and been destroyed by their enemies. The Southern Kingdom of Judah was also in trouble. God was angry with the people of Judah. They did not obey Him. They lived however they wanted to live. They sinned and were unfaithful to God.  \\\\nGod loved His people. He didn\\\\u2019t want to destroy them. God sent prophets like Jeremiah to warn the kings and people to stop sinning and to turn back to God, but they didn\\\\u2019t listen. So God sent His judgment by bringing the king of Babylon to Judah. \\\\nKing Nebuchadnezzar (NEB yoo kad NEZ uhr) invaded Judah and took some of God\\\\u2019s people\\\\u2014the best and most intelligent men\\\\u2014to Babylon. He left Jehoiakim in Judah as king. When Jehoiakim rebelled, Nebuchadnezzar invaded again and took more people captive. Zedekiah was on the throne in Judah when the prophet Jeremiah sent a message to Babylon to encourage God\\\\u2019s people.  \\\\nThis is what Jeremiah\\\\u2019s letter said: \\\\u201cThis message is from God to the people He sent from Jerusalem to Babylon. While you are in Babylon, build houses and live in them. Plant gardens and grow your families. Work and pray for the good of your city. The exile will last 70 years, and then I will come. I promised to bring you back to the land of Judah, and I will keep My promise. \\\\n\\\\u201cI know My plans for you,\\\\u201d God declared. \\\\u201cMy plans are for your good. You have hope and a future. You will seek Me and find Me when you search for Me with all your heart.\\\\u201d God promised to restore His people\\\\u2019s riches and bring them back home. \\\\nJeremiah told the people that they would experience more troubles. In the face of their powerful enemies\\\\u2014the Babylonians\\\\u2014God knew they would feel hopeless. So Jeremiah shared what God would do. God said, \\\\u201cI will set you free and raise up a king for you. Do not be afraid or discouraged. I will save you and be with you. I will bring you back to your land, and you will rejoice. You will be My people, and I will be your God.\\\\u201d\\\\nChrist Connection: God did not abandon His people. The prophet Jeremiah encouraged God\\\\u2019s people. He said God was going to save His people from captivity and raise up a new King\\\\u2014a forever King\\\\u2014from David\\\\u2019s family. \\\\u2009\\\\nREVIEW THE BIBLE STORY\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002In our Bible story today, we saw how God\\\\u2019s people had disobeyed God and refused to listen to the warnings He sent through the prophets. This isn\\\\u2019t the first time God\\\\u2019s people had disobeyed Him. Can you think of another time God\\\\u2019s people sinned and disobeyed Him? [Allow a volunteer to answer.] Because God is good, righteous, perfect, holy, and just, God must punish sin. Sin always has consequences; but even when we are faithless, God is faithful.\\\\nGod\\\\u2019s people faced consequences for their sin, but God never gave up on them. God had warned them time and time again, yet they were unfaithful to Him. God had every right to turn His back on them, but what was His message? Look at Jeremiah 29:11-14. [Choose a volunteer to read the verses aloud.] Through Jeremiah, God told His people that He was not done with them. Rather than abandoning them, God showed His people that He loved them and had a plan to save them. Isn\\\\u2019t that amazing? \\\\nGod\\\\u2019s message to His people gives us hope as well. We can trust that just as God was faithful to be with His people in exile, God will be faithful to us.

More than two million people live in Vancouver, and over half of them in the city speak a first language other than English. More than 200 languages are spoken in the city. Vancouver has beaches and mountains, making it popular among tourists. It is a city that needs many churches because it has many people. But there are not many churches in the area. \\\\nPlay the missions video. Explain that because Vancouver has many people from many different backgrounds, the city needs many different churches to meet the needs and cultures of the people in the area.\\\\nPray for churches in North America to partner with, pray for, and help churches already working in Vancouver. Pray that churches and individuals will also help start new churches in Vancouver to meet people\\\\u2019s needs.\\\\nKey passage ACTIVITY (5 minutes)\\\\nBefore the session, write the words of the key passage on separate index cards, preparing one card per kid. Depending on the size of the group, you may need to write multiple words per card. If your group is large, form two or more groups and prepare extra sets. \\\\nShow the key passage poster.

Choose a volunteer to be the pointer and stand in the middle of the circle. Give the pointer a pool noodle or instruct her to use her pointer finger to point. Give a key passage card to each kid around the circle. The pointer will point the noodle or her pointer finger at the kid with the first word card, signaling him to say the word(s) on the card. The pointer should continue pointing in order of the key passage until kids say the entire key passage.

Then ask kids to take the two balls they made and pinch off a piece from each to make four balls. Finally, guide them to pinch off a piece of dough from each of the four so they have eight all together. Lead the kids to count up all of the play dough balls.\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002How many balls of play dough did we start with?

The Bible is full of stories, illustrations, commands, warnings, and heart-provoking questions that provide for us everything we need.\\\\nYet, throughout our lives, we intentionally disregard God\\\\u2019s words for us.

The answer is simple: We prefer our own way. \\\\nThroughout the Bible, God warns us by direct command and historical example. We find explicit instructions to obey God\\\\u2019s words and explicit assurances of the pending consequences for refusing to obey His words. We find instances where God executes His justice on those unknowingly ignorant toward His instructions and those blatantly defiant toward Him. God takes His words seriously and expects that we do the same. \\\\nWhat is your relationship to God\\\\u2019s words given to us in the Bible? Are you distant, aware, knowledgeable, or in awe?

Should you laugh at a colleague\\\\u2019s derogatory joke? Should you obey God even if it is costly or uncommon among the culture?\\\\nThese major points of decision require a degree of confidence and conviction. The question is not if we have confidence or conviction, but what our confidence is in and where our conviction comes from.\\\\nIn Daniel 1, Daniel was faced with a decision to either honor the Lord or follow the cultural customs of Babylon that dishonored the commands of God. Daniel had a deep confidence in the Lord and a conviction derived from the same. \\\\nPsalm 71:4-5 models the pattern that I imagine Daniel progressed through in determining what to do in this moment of decision: \\\\u201cDeliver me, my God, from the power of the wicked, from the grasp of the unjust and oppressive.

Because God\\\\u2019s people had sinned against Him, God allowed King Nebuchadnezzar to take over the city of Jerusalem.\\\\nKing Nebuchadnezzar\\\\u2019s leaders gathered a group of young men from among God\\\\u2019s people and brought them to Babylon. The king wanted people who were healthy, handsome, and good learners to serve in his palace. Every day, King Nebuchadnezzar gave the young men special meals. They ate the same food and drank the same drinks that the king ate and drank. They would be trained for three years. Then they would be ready to serve the king.\\\\nFour of the young men from Judah were different from the others in the group. They worshiped the Lord, the one true God. Their names were Daniel, Hananiah (HAN uh NIGH uh), Mishael (MISH eh uhl), and Azariah (az uh RIGH uh). The man in charge of the group gave them new Babylonian names. Daniel\\\\u2019s new name was Belteshazzar (bel tih SHAZ uhr). Hananiah\\\\u2019s new name was Shadrach (SHAD rak). Mishael\\\\u2019s new name was Meshach (MEE shak), and Azariah\\\\u2019s new name was Abednego (uh BED-nih goh).\\\\nEven though Daniel and his friends weren\\\\u2019t in Judah anymore, Daniel wanted to be faithful to God. God\\\\u2019s laws told Daniel what he could and could not eat. Daniel was not allowed to eat some of the food that the king gave the young men. Daniel asked the man in charge for permission to eat other foods.\\\\nDaniel said, \\\\u201cTry this for 10 days. Let us eat only vegetables and drink only water. Then see if we are healthier than the other young men.\\\\u201d\\\\nThe guard agreed. At the end of 10 days, Daniel and his friends looked healthier than the young men who had eaten the king\\\\u2019s food. After that, the guard allowed Daniel and his friends to keep drinking water and eating vegetables. \\\\nGod was happy that Daniel obeyed Him. God blessed Daniel and his friends. He made them wise and smart. They learned lots of new things.

[Allow responses.] Daniel firmly made up his mind to not disobey God. This means that Daniel\\\\u2019s heart was set on God above all else. Daniel was faithful because he was true to his commitment to God. \\\\nWorshiping God is not just about singing songs. Worshiping God is about how we live faithfully to God. In our story today, Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego all worshiped God through their faithfulness to Him and His laws. Even when they were offered more satisfying foods from the king, they obeyed God. Their faithfulness showed that they loved God more than anything else. How did God respond to their faithfulness?

King Jesus willingly humbled Himself by dying on the cross for our sin. God raised up Jesus and gave Him honor forever. When we humble ourselves and trust in Jesus, God will raise us up to enjoy Jesus in His kingdom forever.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPREPARE\\\\nPrior TO TEACHING THE SESSION\\\\n\\\\nLeader Bible Study\\\\nDaniel 5 contains several notable instances that are reasons to stop, pray, and consider our own lives. One of the most perplexing questions is derived from the words of the queen who entered the scene following Belshazzar\\\\u2019s inability to make sense of the writing inscribed on the wall by an unfamiliar hand. \\\\nFollowing the mysterious inscription, the king called in those who would have been culturally identified as experts at explaining and creating the unseen. To Belshazzar\\\\u2019s disappointment, none of them could explain the inscription or its meaning. \\\\nThen the queen stepped in with a brilliant thought, derived from past experiences. She recommended Daniel, a man who formerly had profound influence and insight and provided this type of help to the previous king\\\\u2014Belshazzar\\\\u2019s own relative, Nebuchadnezzar.\\\\nConsider the personal challenge that arises at the mention of Daniel\\\\u2019s name. It was Daniel\\\\u2019s past faithfulness that opened the door for present opportunity. And the natural question that flows from this realization is this: Does my faithfulness today lay the groundwork for future opportunities? \\\\nIn Matthew 5:13-16, Jesus described His followers as the \\\\u201csalt of the earth\\\\u201d and the \\\\u201clight of the world.\\\\u201d These descriptions of the people of God lend themselves to cultural influence that shows the power, mercy, grace, and goodness of God. And this type of influence always leaves a mark. In Daniel\\\\u2019s case, the mark was so significant that it gave greater influence to his witness. \\\\nWe can\\\\u2019t undo the past, but we can be decisively committed to the next step, the next moment, and the next opportunity. What if you committed to faithfulness one day at a time? And what if your faithfulness marked the people around you in significant ways? Then I would imagine that your faithfulness will lead to future opportunities for greater influence.\\\\nDon\\\\u2019t waste today. Be faithful to your purpose to live as the salt of the earth and the light of the world. And God will use you today and, Lord willing, multiply your efforts and opportunities tomorrow.\\\\n\\\\nPlaces TO KNOW \\\\nBabylon: large empire that absorbed the nation of Judah and destroyed Jerusalem.

Provide each group with a large bed sheet. Instruct each group to stand on top of the bed sheet. Explain that they cannot step off the bed sheet and they must work together to flip the bed sheet over to its opposite side.\\\\nGuide kids to think about ways they can work together to flip the sheet over. The team to successfully flip the sheet and have kids still standing on it is the winner. \\\\nSAY\\\\u2002\\\\u2009This activity depended on you working together.

A thousand guests came to eat and drink with the king. During the party, King Belshazzar brought out gold and silver containers for his guests to drink from. The containers had been taken from God\\\\u2019s temple in Jerusalem; the king was misusing them. While the king and his guests drank, they worshiped their false gods\\\\u2014gods made of gold, silver, bronze, iron, wood, and stone. \\\\nSuddenly, the feast was interrupted. A hand appeared at the wall, and its fingers began writing a message. The king watched the hand, and he was very afraid! His face was pale, and his legs shook. The king stared at the message on the wall, but he didn\\\\u2019t understand what it meant. \\\\nThe king called for the wise men in his kingdom. \\\\u201cIf anyone can tell me what this message means, I will give him gifts and an important job in my kingdom,\\\\u201d he said. The wise men came, but none of them knew what the message meant. King Belshazzar and his guests were upset. \\\\nThen the queen remembered Daniel. Daniel was wise, so Daniel was called to the palace. Daniel saw the message and understood what it meant. The message was from God.  \\\\nDaniel reminded the king about what happened to his relative, King Nebuchadnezzar (NEB yoo kad NEZ uhr). \\\\u201cGod made King Nebuchadnezzar great,\\\\u201d Daniel said. \\\\u201cBut King Nebuchadnezzar thought too much of himself, so God punished him.\\\\u201d \\\\nKing Belshazzar had not learned from Nebuchadnezzar\\\\u2019s mistakes. King Belshazzar did not love God; he loved himself the most and he worshiped false gods. \\\\nThen Daniel read the message aloud and told the king what the words meant. The words on the wall were MENE (MEE nih), MENE, TEKEL (TEK uhl), PARSIN (PAHR sin). MENE meant that God had counted the days of the kingdom. The king wasn\\\\u2019t going to be king anymore. The next word, TEKEL, meant that God had given the king a report card, and he had failed. The word PARSIN meant that Babylon would be split up and taken over by its enemies. \\\\u2009\\\\nThat night, God\\\\u2019s message came true. King Belshazzar was killed, and a new king named Darius (duh RIGH uhs) took over Babylon.\\\\nChrist Connection: God humbled the proud king of Babylon by taking away his kingdom. King Jesus willingly humbled Himself by dying on the cross for our sin. God raised up Jesus and gave Him honor forever. When we humble ourselves and trust in Jesus, God will raise us up to enjoy Jesus in His kingdom forever.  \\\\nREVIEW THE BIBLE STORY\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002 King Belshazzar was a very proud man. The feast he had was in celebration of his kingdom and his greatness. He even invited 1,000 people to celebrate with him! What did King Belshazzar fail to understand? [Allow responses.] The king should have known that he is not great, only God is great. Everything the king had was a gift from God.  \\\\nGod used Daniel to help the king understand the message from God. What did the message say? [Allow responses.] Daniel told the king that his time as king was over.

One of the most perplexing questions is derived from the words of the queen who entered the scene following Belshazzar\\\\u2019s inability to make sense of the writing inscribed on the wall by an unfamiliar hand. \\\\nFollowing the mysterious inscription, the king called in those who would have been culturally identified as experts at explaining and creating the unseen. To Belshazzar\\\\u2019s disappointment, none of them could explain the inscription or its meaning. \\\\nThen the queen stepped in with a brilliant thought, derived from past experiences. She recommended Daniel, a man who formerly had profound influence and insight and provided this type of help to the previous king\\\\u2014Belshazzar\\\\u2019s own relative, Nebuchadnezzar.\\\\nConsider the personal challenge that arises at the mention of Daniel\\\\u2019s name. It was Daniel\\\\u2019s past faithfulness that opened the door for present opportunity. And the natural question that flows from this realization is this: Does my faithfulness today lay the groundwork for future opportunities? \\\\nIn Matthew 5:13-16, Jesus described His followers as the \\\\u201csalt of the earth\\\\u201d and the \\\\u201clight of the world.\\\\u201d These descriptions of the people of God lend themselves to cultural influence that shows the power, mercy, grace, and goodness of God. And this type of influence always leaves a mark. In Daniel\\\\u2019s case, the mark was so significant that it gave greater influence to his witness. \\\\nWe can\\\\u2019t undo the past, but we can be decisively committed to the next step, the next moment, and the next opportunity.

God is in all places at all times and is always with His people.\\\\nChrist Connection: \\\\nGod is present with us. He sent prophets to His people, even in captivity, and promised to send Immanuel, which means \\\\u201cGod with us.\\\\u201d Jesus fulfilled this promise when He came to earth and was born of a virgin. Jesus is our Immanuel, God with us.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPREPARE\\\\nPrior TO TEACHING THE SESSION\\\\n\\\\nLeader Bible Study\\\\nHave you ever heard someone say something along the lines of, \\\\u201cGod\\\\u2019s promise of the future should give you hope today\\\\u201d? Maybe you\\\\u2019ve heard it dozens of times or said it just as many. In part, this saying stands because we believe the Bible teaches this principle; however, at the gut level, this idea can be challenging to hear and believe. \\\\nIn Isaiah 7, God reminded Ahaz through the prophet Isaiah that he had ample reason to trust God. The evidence? A future promise. In a moment where it would have made sense to the human mind to reference a past experience or previous fulfillment, God chose to offer hope with a word about something that had not yet happened. \\\\nThat future promise was the incarnation of Jesus Christ. God promised a Messiah would come in order to encourage Ahaz to trust the Lord in that moment. \\\\nIn hindsight, it is easy for us to read this and understand that God was forecasting a promise that we know He would ultimately keep. However, at the moment, this must have been perplexing to hear. \\\\nWhen we make our way through the New Testament and discover some of the beautiful and hopeful promises of the second return of Christ, the eternal joy of God\\\\u2019s people, and the faithfulness of God through trial and tribulation, we too might be tempted to wonder if it will actually happen. \\\\nNumbers 23:19 says, \\\\u201cGod is not a man, that he might lie, or a son of man, that he might change his mind. Does he speak and not act, or promise and not fulfill?\\\\u201d God is faithful. We can look to the past and find a record of this truth, which means we can look to the future with continued confidence. God is not a liar. \\\\nThough not overt, our faithlessness in the face of His future promises suggest that we at least think there may be a chance that He is not always true to His Word and faithful to fulfill His promises. Yet He will not waver, and we can set our faith in His faithfulness. \\\\nYes, be thankful for God\\\\u2019s faithfulness in the past, but also be confident in His future promises. God is present with us. He will not change His mind, His character, or His Word. \\\\n\\\\nNames to know\\\\nImmanuel: name meaning \\\\u201cGod with us.\\\\u201d Immanuel was the name of the son to be born in Isaiah\\\\u2019s prophecy to King Ahaz (Isa. 7:14) and fulfilled in the birth of Jesus (Matt. 1:22-23).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nGATHER Supplies\\\\nKeep a regular supply of the following items available at all times: Bibles, pens or pencils, markers, crayons, colored pencils, scissors, glue or tape, paper.\\\\nWELCOME\\\\nActivity Page\\\\n\\\\u201cGod\\\\u2019s Promised Sign\\\\u201d activity page\\\\nSession Starter (Option 1)\\\\nindex cards, 8\\\\nSession Starter (Option 2)\\\\nprint pictures of a pillar of cloud, pillar of fire, tabernacle, and temple\\\\nLEARN\\\\nIntroduce the Session\\\\ncountdown video\\\\nBig Picture Question\\\\nBig Picture Question Poster\\\\nReview the Timeline\\\\nGiant Timeline\\\\nTell the Bible Story\\\\n\\\\u201cGod Is Present with Us\\\\u201d video\\\\nBible Story Picture Poster\\\\nQuestions from Kids\\\\n\\\\u201cUnit 16, Session 4\\\\u201d questions from kids video\\\\nMissions Moment\\\\n\\\\u201cShahid and Maroofa Kamal Photo\\\\u201d printable\\\\nKey Passage Activity\\\\nKey Passage Poster\\\\n\\\\u201cThe Lord Your God (Zephaniah 3:17)\\\\u201d song\\\\nworship song of your choice (optional) \\\\nindex cards\\\\nLOVE\\\\nReview & Bible skills\\\\nSmall Group Timeline and Map Set\\\\nworld map\\\\nLIVE\\\\nActivity Choice (Option 1)\\\\ndry erase board\\\\ndry erase marker\\\\nActivity Choice (Option 2)\\\\nBig Picture Question Poster \\\\nJournal and Prayer\\\\nJournal Page\\\\n\\\\u201cGod Is With Us\\\\u201d activity page\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWELCOME\\\\nWELCOME Kids\\\\nGreet each kid as he or she arrives.

When he ruled over Judah, he did not do what was right. Ahaz made sacrifices and offerings to idols. Idols are people and things that are worshiped but are not the one true God. During Ahaz\\\\u2019s time as king, two other kings\\\\u2014the king of Israel and the king of Aram\\\\u2014agreed to protect each other in battles. King Ahaz gave silver and gold to the king of Assyria. Assyria was a strong nation, and the king of Assyria agreed to protect Judah. \\\\nOne day, Ahaz heard that the kings of Israel and Aram were coming to Judah. Their armies were going to attack Jerusalem! Ahaz was afraid! Everyone in Judah was afraid. \\\\nBut Ahaz didn\\\\u2019t need to be afraid. He should have trusted God. God had promised his ancestor, King David, that He would be with His people. God sent the prophet Isaiah to talk to Ahaz. Isaiah said, \\\\u201cPay attention and be quiet. Trust God. Be confident that God will take care of you.\\\\u201d \\\\nGod had good news for Ahaz. \\\\u201cThe kings of Israel and Syria are planning to attack Jerusalem and make someone else king. But this won\\\\u2019t happen,\\\\u201d God said. \\\\u201cIf you do not trust Me, you will not last.\\\\u201d \\\\nIsaiah said to Ahaz, \\\\u201cListen! God is going to give you a sign to prove He is telling the truth. Here is the sign: A virgin will have a baby. She will name the baby Immanuel.\\\\u201d \\\\nIsaiah told Ahaz that very soon, the kings of Israel and Syria would not be a threat to Judah. \\\\u201cBut,\\\\u201d Isaiah continued, \\\\u201cGod\\\\u2019s judgment is coming. He is going to judge you and the people of Judah. You have not seen judgment like this since Solomon\\\\u2019s kingdom was divided into Israel and Judah. The king of Assyria and his strong army is coming to attack! \\\\nOn that day, God will send enemy armies to Judah. The Assyrians will come from the north, and the Egyptians will come from the south. They will be everywhere, like flies and bees,\\\\u201d Isaiah said. \\\\u201cYou won\\\\u2019t be able to escape!\\\\u201d\\\\nChrist Connection: God is present with us. He sent prophets to His people, even in captivity, and promised to send Immanuel, which means \\\\u201cGod with us.\\\\u201d Jesus fulfilled this promise when He came to earth and was born of a virgin.

Many times God\\\\u2019s people trusted Him when things were going well, but as soon as they encountered something that made them afraid, they doubted Him. King Ahaz reacted this way as well. Instead of trusting God would be with him, he reacted in fear. What was the sign God gave King Ahaz to remind him to trust God? [Allow responses.] God told Ahaz that He was going to send Immanuel\\\\u2014God with us.\\\\nDid God keep His promise? How? [Allow responses.] Jesus is Immanuel. Jesus was born hundreds of years after this promise. God became man and was born to save us from our sins. God has always desired to be with His people, but sin separated us from Him. When God became flesh in the person of Jesus, He made a way for us to be with Him. When we trust in Jesus as our Savior, we have the promise of God\\\\u2019s presence forever. \\\\u2009\\\\nChrist connection\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002\\\\u2009God is present with us. He sent prophets to His people, even in captivity, and promised to send Immanuel, which means \\\\u201cGod with us.\\\\u201d Jesus fulfilled this promise when He came to earth and was born of a virgin. Jesus is our Immanuel, God with us.  \\\\u2009\\\\u2009\\\\n(Tip: Use Scripture and the Gospel Plan Poster to explain how to become a Christian.

God was showing Ahaz that He could be trusted and that He was working out His plan to be with His people. God was sending Immanuel, which means, \\\\u2018God with us.\\\\u2019 \\\\nAhaz was worried, but he was invited to trust in God and the promise of Immanuel. We don\\\\u2019t have to wait on that promise; Jesus has already come!

Maybe you\\\\u2019ve heard it dozens of times or said it just as many. In part, this saying stands because we believe the Bible teaches this principle; however, at the gut level, this idea can be challenging to hear and believe. \\\\nIn Isaiah 7, God reminded Ahaz through the prophet Isaiah that he had ample reason to trust God. The evidence? A future promise. In a moment where it would have made sense to the human mind to reference a past experience or previous fulfillment, God chose to offer hope with a word about something that had not yet happened. \\\\nThat future promise was the incarnation of Jesus Christ. God promised a Messiah would come in order to encourage Ahaz to trust the Lord in that moment. \\\\nIn hindsight, it is easy for us to read this and understand that God was forecasting a promise that we know He would ultimately keep. However, at the moment, this must have been perplexing to hear. \\\\nWhen we make our way through the New Testament and discover some of the beautiful and hopeful promises of the second return of Christ, the eternal joy of God\\\\u2019s people, and the faithfulness of God through trial and tribulation, we too might be tempted to wonder if it will actually happen. \\\\nNumbers 23:19 says, \\\\u201cGod is not a man, that he might lie, or a son of man, that he might change his mind. Does he speak and not act, or promise and not fulfill?\\\\u201d God is faithful. We can look to the past and find a record of this truth, which means we can look to the future with continued confidence. God is not a liar. \\\\nThough not overt, our faithlessness in the face of His future promises suggest that we at least think there may be a chance that He is not always true to His Word and faithful to fulfill His promises. Yet He will not waver, and we can set our faith in His faithfulness. \\\\nYes, be thankful for God\\\\u2019s faithfulness in the past, but also be confident in His future promises.

It\\\\u2019s a word that means something different to each one of us. For some, rest brings to mind a desire to momentarily break from the chaos of life to sleep, relax, and even recover. For others, rest is an unrealistic hope as they navigate a non-stop schedule of busyness. Yet for others, the word rest suggests an uneventful, quiet life of the mundane.\\\\nWhether it\\\\u2019s a nap, a vacation, or boredom that comes to mind when you think of rest, it is likely a word that triggers some desire or response. And almost universally, the thought of rest is primarily physical.  \\\\nThe Bible teaches that rhythms of rest are good and necessary for us; however, the Bible\\\\u2019s primary teaching on rest refers to the spiritual. In Ezra 1, God\\\\u2019s remnant is instructed to recover from their exile with \\\\u2026 work.  \\\\nThis work would be costly, demanding, and long; but this work actually aimed to bring rest. How could this be so? Because their work was to build the place where they would encounter the living God, the One who gives true rest to the soul.  \\\\nIn Matthew 11:28-30, Jesus said, \\\\u201cCome to me, all of you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take up my yoke and learn from me, because I am lowly and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.\\\\u201d  \\\\nThough God clearly teaches us the benefits of a rhythm of physical rest\\\\u2014Sabbath\\\\u2014He ultimately uses physical rest to teach us of our need for a greater spiritual rest\\\\u2014a rest for our soul, a rest that comes in understanding that we cannot save ourselves. God has done everything necessary through Christ to save us. We are invited into this rest through the substitutionary atonement of Jesus.  \\\\nThe people of God are instructed in Ezra 1 to begin the arduous work of building God\\\\u2019s dwelling place. But this work would ultimately lead to their place of rest\\\\u2014in God\\\\u2019s presence.\\\\nWe too may find ourselves physically exhausted from the demanding work of faithfully following the Lord in the context He has placed us. But take heart, there is rest for your soul in the presence of God and the person of Christ. \\\\n\\\\nPeople TO KNOW\\\\nEzra: priest and scribe sent to Jerusalem by the king of Persia.

King Nebuchadnezzar had completely destroyed Jerusalem. Many of God\\\\u2019s people had died. Others lived in Babylon. Some of their children and grandchildren were born in Babylon and grew up there. But Babylon was not their home. \\\\nBefore God\\\\u2019s people were taken away from Judah, God promised through the prophet Jeremiah that the exile would last 70 years; then God would bring His people back to the land. At last, the time had come for God\\\\u2019s people to go home. \\\\nCyrus, king of Persia, had taken over Babylon. God gave Cyrus an idea. Cyrus made an announcement: \\\\u201cGod wants me to build Him a temple in Jerusalem, so let all of God\\\\u2019s people go back to Jerusalem so they can rebuild the Lord\\\\u2019s temple. Anyone who stays behind should give the travelers anything they need\\\\u2014gold and silver, animals, and gifts for God\\\\u2019s temple.\\\\u201d \\\\nThe exile was over! God\\\\u2019s people were free to go back to their homes. God\\\\u2019s promise was coming true. So the people got ready to go to Judah. All their neighbors helped them by giving them gifts: gold and silver, animals, and other expensive things. \\\\nKing Cyrus even brought out the dishes that King Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple in Jerusalem before he destroyed it. The king\\\\u2019s treasurer counted them: 30 gold basins; 1,000 silver basins; 29 silver knives; 30 gold bowls; 410 silver bowls; and 1,000 other pieces. In all, there were 5,400 pieces of gold and silver. \\\\nThe leader of God\\\\u2019s people\\\\u2014a man named Sheshbazzar (shesh BAZ uhr)\\\\u2014brought all these things along when the captives returned from Babylon to Jerusalem. \\\\nChrist Connection: God always keeps His promises. God chose to use King Cyrus in His plan to graciously deliver His people from exile. King Cyrus\\\\u2019 action to free the people reminds us of Jesus, whom God chose to rescue sinners and bring us to our true home in His kingdom of grace. \\\\u2009 \\\\nREVIEW THE BIBLE STORY\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002 When God\\\\u2019s people turned away from Him, God removed them from the land that He had given them. Their exile to Babylon was meant to teach them to turn back to God and worship Him alone.

At the age of 21, he sailed from his home in England to China. It took five and a half months for him to arrive in Shanghai, China. His parents had always been fascinated with East Asia, and they prayed when Hudson was just a newborn baby that he would someday work for God in China. \\\\nHudson spent his teenage years preparing to go to China by learning about medicine and studying Mandarin, a language spoken in China. He also spent time reading his Bible and praying. When Hudson arrived in Shanghai, he only stayed there for a few months before he and another man set off for other areas of China. One time, Hudson and his friend set sail down the Huangpu River and distributed Chinese Bibles and tracts to people they met along the way. \\\\nPray, thanking God for missionaries who have served in the past and who serve now to tell people all over the world about Jesus.\\\\nKey passage ACTIVITY (5 minutes)\\\\nShow the key passage poster.

God does the same for us and provides everything we need at exactly the right time. He already provided salvation once and for all through His Son, Jesus. Jesus miraculously came to earth, died on the cross, and rose from the dead to pay the cost of our sin. We no longer have to be separated from God when we trust Jesus as our Savior.

It\\\\u2019s a word that means something different to each one of us. For some, rest brings to mind a desire to momentarily break from the chaos of life to sleep, relax, and even recover. For others, rest is an unrealistic hope as they navigate a non-stop schedule of busyness. Yet for others, the word rest suggests an uneventful, quiet life of the mundane.\\\\nWhether it\\\\u2019s a nap, a vacation, or boredom that comes to mind when you think of rest, it is likely a word that triggers some desire or response. And almost universally, the thought of rest is primarily physical.  \\\\nThe Bible teaches that rhythms of rest are good and necessary for us; however, the Bible\\\\u2019s primary teaching on rest refers to the spiritual. In Ezra 1, God\\\\u2019s remnant is instructed to recover from their exile with \\\\u2026 work.  \\\\nThis work would be costly, demanding, and long; but this work actually aimed to bring rest. How could this be so? Because their work was to build the place where they would encounter the living God, the One who gives true rest to the soul.  \\\\nIn Matthew 11:28-30, Jesus said, \\\\u201cCome to me, all of you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take up my yoke and learn from me, because I am lowly and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.\\\\u201d  \\\\nThough God clearly teaches us the benefits of a rhythm of physical rest\\\\u2014Sabbath\\\\u2014He ultimately uses physical rest to teach us of our need for a greater spiritual rest\\\\u2014a rest for our soul, a rest that comes in understanding that we cannot save ourselves. God has done everything necessary through Christ to save us. We are invited into this rest through the substitutionary atonement of Jesus.  \\\\nThe people of God are instructed in Ezra 1 to begin the arduous work of building God\\\\u2019s dwelling place. But this work would ultimately lead to their place of rest\\\\u2014in God\\\\u2019s presence.\\\\nWe too may find ourselves physically exhausted from the demanding work of faithfully following the Lord in the context He has placed us. But take heart, there is rest for your soul in the presence of God and the person of Christ. \\\\n\\\\nPeople TO KNOW\\\\nEzra: priest and scribe sent to Jerusalem by the king of Persia.

They are used as ideas or desires that require work to achieve. They are used in the negative sense of not being a current reality. They are used as the aim, answer, or solution to the world\\\\u2019s problems.\\\\nThough the idea of peace and security are not foreign to our vernacular, they are most certainly foreign to much of our world\\\\u2019s reality. It is hard to find a pocket of the earth that might be described with these terms. Rather, what is most found is chaos and fear.  \\\\nWhen we understand the true impact of sin on the world, this comes as no surprise. It\\\\u2019s not shocking to see the news of war and violence. It does not bring amazement to hear of murder and strife. There is no astonishment at the experience of disappointment or pain because we know that we live in a world riddled with sin and its implications. \\\\nRead the words of Zechariah 14:11. What comes to mind? \\\\u201cPeople will live there, and never again will there be a curse of complete destruction. So Jerusalem will dwell in security.\\\\u201d\\\\nAre you struck by the thought of such a place that could be described as secure? Are you left longing for that to be your reality? Are you doubtful that this could ever be a reality? \\\\nUltimately, this is a promise that is sure to happen. This promise is reiterated in Deuteronomy 7:7-9:\\\\n\\\\u201cThe LORD had his heart set on you and chose you, not because you were more numerous than all peoples, for you were the fewest of all peoples. But because the LORD loved you and kept the oath he swore to your ancestors, he brought you out with a strong hand and redeemed you from the place of slavery, from the power of Pharaoh king of Egypt. Know that the LORD your God is God, the faithful God who keeps his gracious covenant loyalty for a thousand generations with those who love him and keep his commands.\\\\u201d \\\\nThis promise was for God\\\\u2019s people then, and it is for all who follow Jesus today as well.

In today\\\\u2019s Bible story, God\\\\u2019s people were faced with a challenge to rebuild the temple while others tried to stop them.

They started the work, but their neighbors didn\\\\u2019t want them to rebuild the temple, so they stopped. \\\\nGod sent prophets to encourage His people to finish the temple and give them a message. One of those prophets was named Zechariah (ZEK uh RIGH uh). God told Zechariah what would happen in the future, and then Zechariah told the people what God said. \\\\nZechariah gave a message of hope. He shared what God would do for His people in the future. This is what Zechariah said: \\\\u201cA day is coming when the Lord will remove every idol from this land. No one will remember them or worship them.\\\\u201d God was going to set up a new kingdom over the nations. \\\\nZechariah said God would give His people a new king\\\\u2014like a shepherd caring for a flock of sheep. \\\\u201cThen God will say, \\\\u2018Sword, strike my shepherd,\\\\u2019 and the sheep will scatter. There will be troubles, but God will be doing something good,\\\\u201d Zechariah explained. \\\\nIn this new kingdom, God will judge and punish all evil. He will lead His own people back to Himself. Zechariah said, \\\\u201cThe people will call out to God, and He will answer them.

They still needed to rebuild the temple and make Jerusalem their home again. God also had an even bigger plan to restore the people\\\\u2019s relationship with Him forever.\\\\nWhat was God\\\\u2019s plan for the future? Look at Zechariah 13:1. [Choose a volunteer to read aloud Zechariah 13:1.] God had a plan to wash away the sin that separated people from Him. Jesus is the fountain whose blood was poured out to wash away our sin. Jesus paid the cost of our sin. Through faith in Jesus, we can be cleansed from our sin once and for all. \\\\nThe exiles who returned to Jerusalem faced troubles while rebuilding the temple. How did Zechariah\\\\u2019s message give them hope? Look at Zechariah 14:11. [Choose a volunteer to read aloud Zechariah 13:9.] Jerusalem was in utter destruction. The people\\\\u2019s sin had visible results. Zechariah\\\\u2019s message gave the people hope because God\\\\u2019s promise to wash away their sin also meant that God\\\\u2019s people would dwell in security. Not only would all things that are broken be made new, but they would be saved from the wrath of God. Jesus secures our future and offers us a way to be saved. \\\\u2009\\\\nChrist connection\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002\\\\u2009Zechariah spoke a message of hope to God\\\\u2019s people.

Tell the kids that Hudson married a lady named Maria Dyer, a daughter of another missionary couple in China. \\\\nSAY\\\\u2002 After Hudson was married, he continued his work in China. His church grew to 21 members. In 1861, he became very ill and went back to England to recover. While he was in England, Hudson continued translating the Bible into Chinese, as he had been doing while he was in China. He also worked to recruit more missionaries. \\\\nHudson began a ministry called \\\\u2018China Inland Mission\\\\u2019 (CIM). Hudson continued to pray for more missionaries to come to China.

Like the people of Judah, we will face hardships, but we can trust God and have hope knowing Jesus\\\\u2019 sufferings secure our future. There are no trials that can separate us from God or undo God\\\\u2019s promises. God\\\\u2019s promise to save us and make a new kingdom came true in Jesus\\\\u2019 life, death, and resurrection.

They are used as ideas or desires that require work to achieve. They are used in the negative sense of not being a current reality. They are used as the aim, answer, or solution to the world\\\\u2019s problems.\\\\nThough the idea of peace and security are not foreign to our vernacular, they are most certainly foreign to much of our world\\\\u2019s reality. It is hard to find a pocket of the earth that might be described with these terms. Rather, what is most found is chaos and fear.  \\\\nWhen we understand the true impact of sin on the world, this comes as no surprise. It\\\\u2019s not shocking to see the news of war and violence. It does not bring amazement to hear of murder and strife. There is no astonishment at the experience of disappointment or pain because we know that we live in a world riddled with sin and its implications. \\\\nRead the words of Zechariah 14:11. What comes to mind? \\\\u201cPeople will live there, and never again will there be a curse of complete destruction.

Yes, God cannot lie or ever be wrong, so we can trust whatever He has said.\\\\nChrist Connection: \\\\nGod\\\\u2019s people rebuilt the temple so they would have a place to worship God. Years later, God sent His Son, Jesus, to be with His people. Now, God does not dwell with His people through the temple. Instead, God dwells directly with His people through His Spirit. Jesus provided something better than the temple; He gives us Himself.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPREPARE\\\\nPrior TO TEACHING THE SESSION\\\\n\\\\nLeader Bible Study\\\\nImagine this for a moment: It\\\\u2019s late Saturday night, and you\\\\u2019ve been out of the house all day. You\\\\u2019ve gone from place to place, striving to complete more than seemed possible from your calendar to-do list. You\\\\u2019ve just returned home and sat down for dinner. Suddenly, you remember that tomorrow is Sunday. You quickly recall that you are scheduled to serve with preschoolers tomorrow morning, your small group is having lunch together after church, and you have yet to plan out this upcoming week. The thought crosses your mind, What if I just sat this one out tomorrow? \\\\nDoes this scenario hit close to home? \\\\nIn Ezra 3, as the work had begun to rebuild the temple, there was an eager desire among God\\\\u2019s people, leading them to anticipate what that place would afford them upon its completion. As the people worked and waited, even in the midst of their exhaustion, they made time to worship. \\\\nRead Ezra 3:6. Not only was the temple incomplete, but the first stage of the build was not yet done. Still, the laborers did not forget or fail to keep the purpose at the forefront of their minds. The goal was not the temple; it was the Lord. \\\\nWe often find ourselves in scenarios like the one above, ready to make excuses to not do the things that matter most because we\\\\u2019ve misplaced our priorities\\\\u2014or at least lost sight of them in the whirlwind of life. Our decisions reflect what has the seat of greatest importance in our lives. \\\\nHebrews 10:24-25 says, \\\\u201cAnd let us consider one another in order to provoke love and good works, not neglecting to gather together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging each other, and all the more as you see the day approaching.\\\\u201d \\\\nUnderstanding Christ to be our greatest purpose and prize ought to direct our paths toward prioritizing our lives around Christ and His church. Not only will this be good for us, but it will be good for the rest of God\\\\u2019s children as well. When we are eager to be with the Lord and His people, not only will we be productive, but we will be truly satisfied.\\\\nPeople TO KNOW \\\\nZerubbabel: grandson of King Jehoiachin.

His faithful love will last forever.\\\\u201d \\\\nNot everyone was happy though. Some of the older people remembered what the temple had looked like before it had been destroyed. They cried and \\\\nshouted loudly. \\\\nSometimes other people interrupted the rebuilding of the temple by making the people of Judah discouraged or afraid. At one point, the building of the temple stopped for a while. God sent prophets to encourage the people, and they started working again. \\\\nAt this time, Darius (duh RIGH uhs), the king of Persia, ruled over the land of Judah. The king was in charge of a lot of land, so he put governors in charge of some of the land. A governor named Tattenai (TAT ih nigh) noticed what God\\\\u2019s people were doing. \\\\nTattenai asked the workers, \\\\u201cDo you have permission to rebuild this temple?\\\\u201d The workers said, \\\\u201cWe do.\\\\u201d Still, Tattenai sent a report to the king about what God\\\\u2019s people were doing. \\\\u201cThey said King Cyrus gave them permission to rebuild the temple,\\\\u201d Tattenai wrote. \\\\u201cPlease search the royal records to see if this is true.\\\\u201d \\\\nKing Darius\\\\u2019s officials searched the royal records for Cyrus\\\\u2019s order. They found it\\\\u2014a scroll with a record from King Cyrus. This is what was written on the scroll: \\\\u201cLet God\\\\u2019s temple be rebuilt. It will be a place to offer sacrifices. Let its foundation be rebuilt.\\\\u201d King Cyrus had also ordered for the cost of building the temple to be paid for out of the royal treasury. \\\\nSo King Darius sent a letter back to Tattenai. He gave this order: \\\\u201cStay away from the workers in Jerusalem. Don\\\\u2019t bother them or try to stop them. Give them whatever they need.\\\\u201d \\\\u2009\\\\nTattenai obeyed the king\\\\u2019s order. The Jewish leaders kept building, and they finally finished the temple of God! The people celebrated and made offerings to God. They chose priests and assistants to serve in the temple. Then God\\\\u2019s people celebrated the Passover. God\\\\u2019s people were so happy. Now the temple of God was finally complete.\\\\nChrist Connection: God\\\\u2019s people rebuilt the temple so they would have a place to worship God. Years later, God sent His Son, Jesus, to be with His people. Now, God does not dwell with His people through the temple. Instead, God dwells directly with His people through His Spirit. Jesus provided something better than the temple; He gives us Himself. \\\\nREVIEW THE BIBLE STORY\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002 The temple was the place the Jews worshiped God. It also represented God\\\\u2019s presence with His people. God\\\\u2019s plan for the people to rebuild the temple was meant to be a reminder that He was with them and that they should worship Him alone.\\\\nWhat did God\\\\u2019s people do first when they settled back in Jerusalem? Look at Ezra 3:2. [Choose a volunteer to read aloud Ezra 3:2.] God\\\\u2019s people rebuilt the altar first. They offered sacrifices for their sin and praised God. Then they laid the foundation of the temple. Some of the older people were sad that the temple did not look like the original. Even though the temple was different, God was still with His people. It was not how the temple looked that was important, but how God had continued to be faithful to His people. \\\\nWhy were the neighbors of God\\\\u2019s people unable to stop the rebuilding of the temple? [Allow responses.] God put a plan in place to provide for His people years before they would need it! God\\\\u2019s promise was put in writing by King Cyrus. Nothing can stop God\\\\u2019s words from coming true. Can God be trusted? Yes, God cannot lie or ever be wrong, so we can trust whatever He has said. \\\\u2009\\\\nChrist connection\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002\\\\u2009 God\\\\u2019s people rebuilt the temple so they would have a place to worship God.

You\\\\u2019ve gone from place to place, striving to complete more than seemed possible from your calendar to-do list. You\\\\u2019ve just returned home and sat down for dinner. Suddenly, you remember that tomorrow is Sunday. You quickly recall that you are scheduled to serve with preschoolers tomorrow morning, your small group is having lunch together after church, and you have yet to plan out this upcoming week. The thought crosses your mind, What if I just sat this one out tomorrow? \\\\nDoes this scenario hit close to home? \\\\nIn Ezra 3, as the work had begun to rebuild the temple, there was an eager desire among God\\\\u2019s people, leading them to anticipate what that place would afford them upon its completion. As the people worked and waited, even in the midst of their exhaustion, they made time to worship. \\\\nRead Ezra 3:6. Not only was the temple incomplete, but the first stage of the build was not yet done. Still, the laborers did not forget or fail to keep the purpose at the forefront of their minds. The goal was not the temple; it was the Lord. \\\\nWe often find ourselves in scenarios like the one above, ready to make excuses to not do the things that matter most because we\\\\u2019ve misplaced our priorities\\\\u2014or at least lost sight of them in the whirlwind of life.

Yes, God cannot lie or ever be wrong, so we can trust whatever He has said.\\\\nChrist Connection: \\\\nGod\\\\u2019s words brought hope to God\\\\u2019s people because His words were true. God can always be trusted. Jeremiah told about a day when God would forgive sin and change people\\\\u2019s hearts. Jesus\\\\u2019 death and resurrection provides forgiveness of sins. Through Jesus, we have new hearts and life with God forever.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPREPARE\\\\nPrior TO TEACHING THE SESSION\\\\n\\\\nLeader Bible Study\\\\nThere\\\\u2019s a strong likelihood that you have had to repeat a message to the same person multiple times, whether that person is a spouse, child, coworker, or friend. Some things are so important they are worth repeating. And some people are so quick to forget, we must repeat. \\\\nFor example, each of my four children have gone through seasons when brushing their teeth was such a chore that you would have thought they were being asked to eat nails. My wife and I would remind them dozens of times in the morning and dozens of times in the evening to brush their teeth, and yet still we would later find evidence that it didn\\\\u2019t happen. I feel confident none of them were belligerent in wanting their teeth to rot, but we were loving enough to remind them that this was likely to happen if they didn\\\\u2019t remember to complete this menial task a couple of times a day. \\\\nIn Jeremiah 31, there is a phrase that is repeated by the Lord to the hearer of these words. The phrase, \\\\u201cthe LORD\\\\u2019s declaration\\\\u201d occurs 10 times in these 40 verses. These words even appear at times in the middle of a thought or sentence, uniquely placed to garner great attention. In addition the phrase, \\\\u201cThis is what the Lord says\\\\u201d occurs seven times. Clearly, the Lord wants the hearers to be abundantly clear from whom these words are coming. \\\\nWe are most certainly forgetful people, often forgetting the smallest of details and even the most significant of facts. The Lord knows us on the deepest level and knows how great our need is for direct reminders. \\\\nJeremiah 31 contains difficult truths and delightful promises. God knows that the hearer is likely to bristle at the warnings and rejoice in the hope, but he also seemingly wants to ensure that we who read these words do not forget that they are His words. \\\\nAs we read the Bible, it is crucial that we recall the voice behind the words: the voice of God. Only God has the highest authority, holds all knowledge, and is perfectly good. Maybe you need to remember as you read and listen to God\\\\u2019s Word that this is the Lord\\\\u2019s declaration.\\\\n\\\\nDoctrine TO KNOW\\\\nGod is truthful: In God, there is no falsehood (Titus 1:2; Heb. 6:18).

After 70 years in Babylon, King Cyrus sent God\\\\u2019s people back to Jerusalem to rebuild the temple. God also used King Cyrus to give His people whatever they needed. When their neighbors tried to stop their work, God sent prophets to encourage them and give them hope. God\\\\u2019s plans could not be stopped and the people eventually completed the temple.

He warned the people of God\\\\u2019s judgment because of their sin. But even though the people disobeyed, God had not abandoned them. His love never stopped, and God had a good plan for His people. \\\\nGod spoke through Jeremiah. This is what the Lord said: \\\\u201cOn the day when I restore My people to their land, I will be the God of all the families of Israel. They will be My people.\\\\u201d God\\\\u2019s people had been divided, but God was going to bring them back together. \\\\nThe people suffered in exile, but God said, \\\\u201cYou will make music again. You will dance with joy!\\\\u201d God was going to bring His people back home. He had scattered Israel, but He would gather them again. He would watch over them like a shepherd guards his flock. \\\\nGod said, \\\\u201cI will turn their mourning into joy, comfort them, and bring happiness out of grief. My people will be satisfied with My goodness.\\\\u201d \\\\nGod declared, \\\\u201cThere is hope for your future!\\\\u201d  \\\\nJeremiah told the people of Judah that God had a plan to change their hearts. God promised a new and better covenant so they could be saved from \\\\ntheir sins. \\\\nGod said that the new covenant would not be like the old covenant. In the old covenant, the people had God\\\\u2019s commands in writing. They disobeyed His commands and had to make sacrifices every year for their sin. In the new covenant, God was going to write His law on their hearts. That means He would give His people the power to obey His commands. God said, \\\\u201cI will forgive their wrongdoing and never again remember their sin.\\\\u201d\\\\nChrist Connection: God\\\\u2019s words brought hope to God\\\\u2019s people because His words were true. God can always be trusted. Jeremiah told about a day when God would forgive sin and change people\\\\u2019s hearts. Jesus\\\\u2019 death and resurrection provides forgiveness of sins. Through Jesus, we have new hearts and life with God forever. \\\\u2009\\\\nREVIEW THE BIBLE STORY\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002 Before God\\\\u2019s people ever went into exile in Babylon, God used Jeremiah to warn the people of Judah what would happen. The people of Judah ignored Jeremiah\\\\u2019s words and God punished their sin. The people of Judah were sad and afraid as they were taken away to Babylon. How did Jeremiah give the people hope? [Allow responses.] Jeremiah told the people that not only was God going to bring them back home to Judah, but He was also going to give them a way for their sins to be forgiven forever.\\\\nJeremiah told the people that God was going to give them a new covenant. What were some things Jeremiah said about the new covenant? [Allow responses.] God\\\\u2019s law was going to be written on hearts, it would wash away our sin forever, and it would help us obey Him. \\\\nHow did God fulfill His promise to give us a new covenant? [Allow responses.] God fulfilled this promise through Jesus! In Christ, we have the forgiveness of sins, new hearts that can love God rightly, and we are given the power to say \\\\u2018no\\\\u2019 to sin. God words will never fail and we can always trust Him. \\\\u2009\\\\nChrist connection\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002\\\\u2009God\\\\u2019s words brought hope to God\\\\u2019s people because His words were true.

Hudson was able to build relationships with the Chinese people and learned Mandarin so he could tell them about Jesus. Help kids understand that the China Inland Mission (CIM) that Taylor founded is still in operation today under another name to support missionaries in China. \\\\nSAY\\\\u2002The CIM, under Taylor\\\\u2019s leadership, established 20 mission stations, brought 849 missionaries to China while he was there, trained over 700 Chinese workers, raised money, and developed a witnessing Chinese church of over 125,000 people. \\\\nPray, thanking God for missionaries, like Hudson Taylor, who were faithful to tell people in China about Jesus and for missionaries serving in other countries throughout the world.\\\\nKey passage ACTIVITY (5 minutes)\\\\nShow the key passage poster.

Through Jesus, we have new hearts and life with God forever.\", \"leader\": \"Leader Bible Study\\\\nThere\\\\u2019s a strong likelihood that you have had to repeat a message to the same person multiple times, whether that person is a spouse, child, coworker, or friend. Some things are so important they are worth repeating. And some people are so quick to forget, we must repeat. \\\\nFor example, each of my four children have gone through seasons when brushing their teeth was such a chore that you would have thought they were being asked to eat nails. My wife and I would remind them dozens of times in the morning and dozens of times in the evening to brush their teeth, and yet still we would later find evidence that it didn\\\\u2019t happen. I feel confident none of them were belligerent in wanting their teeth to rot, but we were loving enough to remind them that this was likely to happen if they didn\\\\u2019t remember to complete this menial task a couple of times a day. \\\\nIn Jeremiah 31, there is a phrase that is repeated by the Lord to the hearer of these words. The phrase, \\\\u201cthe LORD\\\\u2019s declaration\\\\u201d occurs 10 times in these 40 verses. These words even appear at times in the middle of a thought or sentence, uniquely placed to garner great attention. In addition the phrase, \\\\u201cThis is what the Lord says\\\\u201d occurs seven times. Clearly, the Lord wants the hearers to be abundantly clear from whom these words are coming. \\\\nWe are most certainly forgetful people, often forgetting the smallest of details and even the most significant of facts. The Lord knows us on the deepest level and knows how great our need is for direct reminders. \\\\nJeremiah 31 contains difficult truths and delightful promises. God knows that the hearer is likely to bristle at the warnings and rejoice in the hope, but he also seemingly wants to ensure that we who read these words do not forget that they are His words. \\\\nAs we read the Bible, it is crucial that we recall the voice behind the words: the voice of God. Only God has the highest authority, holds all knowledge, and is perfectly good. Maybe you need to remember as you read and listen to God\\\\u2019s Word that this is the Lord\\\\u2019s declaration.\\\\n\\\\nDoctrine TO KNOW\\\\nGod is truthful: In God, there is no falsehood (Titus 1:2; Heb. 6:18).

For some it may be money; for others, possessions; for others, power or a relationship or a feeling. \\\\nWe live in a broken world and may often fantasize about what life would be like if our ideals came to pass. We may even hurt or mistreat others in pursuit of our dreams\\\\u2014to gain that which we believe has the greatest importance. But the reality is that even if we have all that we want, there is still a great temptation to desire more and continue seeking our own good at the expense of others. \\\\nHowever, we don\\\\u2019t find this temptation when we read about the life of Mordecai in the Book of Esther. We observe Mordecai\\\\u2019s journey from faithful adoptive father of a young girl in a foreign land to his becoming the king\\\\u2019s right-hand man. \\\\nMordecai was faithful. He was faithful to take in Esther, his cousin who was without father or mother. He was faithful to sit, wait, and watch every day at the gate of the king\\\\u2019s palace to see what God would do through this beautiful young woman. He was faithful to speak up with boldness and confidence, even at the threat of death. And he was faithful to lead beside the king in an honorable way seeking the flourishing of the kingdom. \\\\nMordecai rose to a position of great power and authority. Many figures in power tend to forget their roots, turning to selfishness and unfaithfulness. Mordecai, however, did not. Read Esther 10:3.\\\\nIn our temptation to seek our own pleasure, we must remember that our Savior, Jesus Christ, \\\\u201cdid not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many\\\\u201d (Mark 10:45). In remembering the work of Christ, we find not only an example to follow but also the power to do the same. \\\\nChrist in us seeks the good of those around us.

[Distribute Bibles to kids who do not have one.] Our story today will help us learn how God is always in control. Even when bad people are planning evil things, God still remains in control and protects His people. \\\\nOur story today comes from a book in the Old Testament. It is the Book of Esther. Like all of Scripture, the Book of Esther helps us trust that God is always working for the good of His people. As we read Esther, we should be reminded that God is our Deliverer who sent Jesus to save us from sin and death. \\\\u2009\\\\nBig picture question (1 minute)\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002\\\\u2009Each week when we are together, we learn a big picture question and answer. This question helps us focus on a truth from God\\\\u2019s Word. Our big picture question for the next few weeks is, How should we feel when we sin? The answer is, When we sin, we should feel sorry that we have disobeyed God and want to turn from our sin because we love Him. \\\\nSin separates us from God and dishonors Him. Our hearts should be saddened that our sin shows how we have not loved God rightly. God is worthy of all our love and obedience. Let\\\\u2019s say the big picture question and answer again. How should we feel when we sin? When we sin, we should feel sorry that we have disobeyed God and want to turn from our sin because we love Him. \\\\u2009\\\\u2009\\\\nReview the timeline (1 minute)\\\\nShow the giant timeline.

Long ago, God made a covenant with Abraham and promised to make him into a great nation. He also promised that through Abraham, the whole world would be blessed. And God is always faithful to His promises. Even when His people disobeyed, God was still faithful. God was making a way for His people to be saved. Though His people were taken captive to Babylon, God\\\\u2019s faithful promise to protect His people and bless the nations through them would not fail. In today\\\\u2019s story, we will learn how God saves His people from an evil plan meant to destroy them. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2009\\\\u2009\\\\nLEARN the Bible Story\\\\nTELL THE BIBLE STORY: VIDEO OR STORYTELLER (10 minutes)\\\\nOpen your Bible to Esther.

Many years earlier, when Cyrus was king, he sent some of God\\\\u2019s people back to Judah to rebuild the temple in Jerusalem. Another group of God\\\\u2019s people stayed in Persia. God\\\\u2019s people were called Jews because they were from Judah. The king of Persia chose Esther to be his queen. Esther didn\\\\u2019t tell the king that she was a Jew. \\\\nOne day, Mordecai heard that Haman, an important leader who worked for the king, was planning to kill all the Jews. Mordecai was upset! He was a Jew; he didn\\\\u2019t want all the people he loved to be killed. Mordecai and all the Jews cried. \\\\nEsther didn\\\\u2019t know what was wrong. She sent a messenger to ask Mordecai why all the Jews were upset. Mordecai told Esther about Haman\\\\u2019s evil plan. \\\\n\\\\u201cYou have to do something!\\\\u201d Mordecai said. \\\\u201cAsk the king to stop Haman. Ask him to save the Jewish people.\\\\u201d \\\\nEsther sent a message back to Mordecai. \\\\u201cNo one can approach the king unless the king calls for that person first,\\\\u201d Esther said. \\\\u201cThe punishment is death\\\\u2014unless the king holds out his scepter; then you may live.\\\\u201d \\\\n\\\\u201cYou\\\\u2019re a Jew,\\\\u201d Mordecai said. \\\\u201cIf you don\\\\u2019t stop Haman, he will kill you too. Maybe this is why you are the queen.\\\\u201d Maybe God put Esther in the palace to save her people! Esther asked Mordecai and the Jews to fast for three days. Then Esther would go to the king, even if it meant she might die. \\\\nOn the third day, Esther went to the king. He saw Esther and held out his golden scepter. \\\\u201cWhat is it, Queen Esther?\\\\u201d the king asked. \\\\u201cWhat do you want to ask me? I\\\\u2019ll give you anything\\\\u2014up to half of my kingdom.\\\\u201d \\\\nEsther said, \\\\u201cWould you and Haman come to a feast today?\\\\u201d \\\\nSo Haman and the king went to Esther\\\\u2019s feast. After eating, the king said, \\\\u201cWhat do you want, Queen Esther? I\\\\u2019ll give you anything\\\\u2014up to half of my kingdom.\\\\u201d \\\\n\\\\u201cCome to my feast tomorrow,\\\\u201d Esther said. \\\\nThe king agreed. The next day, Haman and the king went to Esther\\\\u2019s feast. After eating, the king said, \\\\u201cWhat do you want, Queen Esther? I\\\\u2019ll give you anything\\\\u2014up to half of my kingdom.\\\\u201d \\\\u2009\\\\nEsther spoke up, \\\\u201cThere is a plan to kill me and my people.\\\\u201d \\\\nThe king replied, \\\\u201cWho is responsible for this plan?\\\\u201d \\\\n\\\\u201cThis evil enemy\\\\u2014Haman!\\\\u201d Esther said. \\\\nThe king was angry! He punished Haman and made a law to keep the Jewish people safe from their enemies.\\\\nChrist Connection: God was in control over Haman\\\\u2019s evil plan to destroy the Jews. Like Haman, Satan wants to ruin God\\\\u2019s plan and destroy believers. Satan thought he had won when Jesus died on the cross, but God raised Jesus from the dead and defeated Satan once and for all. All who believe in Jesus are rescued from sin and death. \\\\nREVIEW THE BIBLE STORY\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002 God allowed Esther to be chosen as the queen. Did Esther tell the king that she was a Jew? Look at Esther 2:20. [Choose a volunteer to read aloud Esther 2:20.] Mordecai had instructed Esther not to reveal that she was a Jew. Some people in Persia did not like Jews. \\\\nWhen Mordecai heard of Haman\\\\u2019s plot against the Jews, Mordecai encouraged Esther to use her position as queen and speak to the king to help save her people. Haman\\\\u2019s evil plot was meant to destroy the Jewish nation. But what did Mordecai say would happen even if Esther kept silent about Haman\\\\u2019s evil plan? Look at Esther 4:13-14. [Choose a volunteer to read aloud Esther 4:13-14.] Mordecai was convinced that God would protect and rescue His people, even if Esther did not speak up about Haman\\\\u2019s plan. Still, Mordecai encouraged Esther to consider why she had been placed in the palace at this exact time. God placed Esther in her position as queen to protect His people. He continues to protect and rescue His people from the evil one who wants to destroy. God rescued His people then and He has rescued His people for all eternity through Jesus. \\\\u2009\\\\nChrist connection\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002\\\\u2009 God was in control over Haman\\\\u2019s evil plan to destroy the Jews. Like Haman, Satan wants to ruin God\\\\u2019s plan and destroy believers. Satan thought he had won when Jesus died on the cross, but God raised Jesus from the dead and defeated Satan once and for all. All who believe in Jesus are rescued from sin and death.  \\\\n(Tip: Use Scripture and the Gospel Plan Poster to explain how to become a Christian.

Why?\\\\nWho are some other people in the Bible that trusted God and did what was right, even in hard times?\\\\u2009\\\\u2009\\\\nMissions moment (3 minutes) \\\\nShow a world map to the kids and point to Southeast Asia. Explain that for security purposes, you cannot name the specific country where David and Lark Washington (names changed) are serving as missionaries. \\\\nSAY\\\\u2002 David and Lark Washington are serving in a place where the country is in a state of unrest with the government. People who live there are afraid and confused. The missionaries have continued to tell people about Jesus through the difficult days in the country. \\\\nPlay the missions video. Explain that many businesses and churches in this country were closed for long periods of time. People who left the country were not allowed back into the country unless they stayed quarantined for two weeks in a government-run hospital when they returned. Some regions did not allow anyone who was not from the area to enter it. Help kids understand that missionaries had to find creative, new ways to continue telling people about Jesus. Tell kids that David was able to speak to several people as he read his Bible from on top of a ladder.\\\\nPray for the missionaries serving in Southeast Asia. Pray for their safety and wisdom as they continue serving God in difficult situations.\\\\nKey passage ACTIVITY (5 minutes)\\\\nBefore the session, use a dry erase board to write out the key passage but leave out several words.\\\\nShow the key passage poster.

(Tip: Locate the areas in and around modern-day Iran.) \\\\nChoose a volunteer to read aloud Esther 8:17.\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002 Throughout the Book of Esther, we see how God directed every event and every person in order to protect His people. God placed Esther in a position of leadership and influence so that, at just the right moment, she could address the king and reveal Haman\\\\u2019s evil plan against the Jews.  \\\\nThe Book of Esther reminds us that God is always in control over every situation. Nothing is a surprise to Him and His plans will always succeed. Throughout the Bible, we see how God protects His people. God still protects His people today. God sent Jesus, at just the right time, to rescue us from sin and death so that we can live with Him forever.  \\\\u2009\\\\nGROUP DISCUSSION (10 minutes)\\\\nAsk the following questions.

For some it may be money; for others, possessions; for others, power or a relationship or a feeling. \\\\nWe live in a broken world and may often fantasize about what life would be like if our ideals came to pass. We may even hurt or mistreat others in pursuit of our dreams\\\\u2014to gain that which we believe has the greatest importance. But the reality is that even if we have all that we want, there is still a great temptation to desire more and continue seeking our own good at the expense of others. \\\\nHowever, we don\\\\u2019t find this temptation when we read about the life of Mordecai in the Book of Esther. We observe Mordecai\\\\u2019s journey from faithful adoptive father of a young girl in a foreign land to his becoming the king\\\\u2019s right-hand man. \\\\nMordecai was faithful. He was faithful to take in Esther, his cousin who was without father or mother. He was faithful to sit, wait, and watch every day at the gate of the king\\\\u2019s palace to see what God would do through this beautiful young woman. He was faithful to speak up with boldness and confidence, even at the threat of death. And he was faithful to lead beside the king in an honorable way seeking the flourishing of the kingdom. \\\\nMordecai rose to a position of great power and authority. Many figures in power tend to forget their roots, turning to selfishness and unfaithfulness. Mordecai, however, did not.

When we sin, we should feel sorry that we have disobeyed God and want to turn from our sin because we love Him.\\\\nChrist Connection: \\\\nNehemiah led the people to rebuild the walls around Jerusalem to protect them from their enemies. Jesus came to protect us from our greatest enemies, sin and death. He died on the cross and rose from the dead to rescue everyone who trusts in Him.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPREPARE\\\\nPrior TO TEACHING THE SESSION\\\\n\\\\nLeader Bible Study\\\\nRecall the last time you were faced with devastating news or found yourself filled with angst, worry, or fear. How did you respond? \\\\nAnger and bitterness are common reactions to bad news. We may feel tempted to isolate ourselves from others. Grief is complex, and responses vary greatly. However, according to the Bible, Nehemiah\\\\u2019s response is the best response. \\\\nWe read about Nehemiah\\\\u2019s general response in Nehemiah 1:4. Then in Nehemiah 1:5-11, we discover the specific way that Nehemiah prayed in response to this devastating news. He recognized God\\\\u2019s faithfulness, requested God\\\\u2019s ear, confessed sin, and committed his people to the Lord\\\\u2019s care. \\\\nNehemiah began his prayer with a recognition of the faithfulness of God. He indicated his confidence that God had been and would continue to be faithful. He then requested God\\\\u2019s ear. Though Nehemiah was confident that God heard him, he opened and closed his prayer of dependence by begging God to listen to his request.  \\\\nWhy did Nehemiah pray this way? Likely, he was further demonstrating his deep conviction that God and God alone is able to work in such a way that would bring about restoration. \\\\nNehemiah\\\\u2019s prayer also demonstrates his belief that sin has serious consequences. He confessed his own sin and the sin of his family, recognizing that God was fully aware of their sin, but also that this sin was not to be taken lightly and needed to be dealt with. \\\\nFinally, he committed his family\\\\u2014the Jewish people\\\\u2014into the hands of this faithful and just God.

Then King Cyrus, the king of Persia, took over Babylon and let them go home. Some of God\\\\u2019s people went home to Judah, but some of them stayed in Babylon. Nehemiah (NEE huh MIGH uh) stayed and worked for the king of Persia. \\\\nOne day, some men came from Judah. Nehemiah asked, \\\\u201cHow are God\\\\u2019s people in Jerusalem?\\\\u201d The men had bad news: \\\\u201cThe people are in trouble. The walls around Jerusalem are broken down, and the gates are burned down.\\\\u201d \\\\nNehemiah sat down and cried. Then he spent time praying and fasting. The king noticed Nehemiah and asked, \\\\u201cWhat\\\\u2019s wrong? Why are you sad?\\\\u201d Nehemiah was afraid; no one was supposed to be sad around the king. Nehemiah said, \\\\u201cThe city where my ancestors are from is in ruins.\\\\u201d \\\\nThe king sent Nehemiah to Jerusalem. Nehemiah led the people to start rebuilding the walls and gates. The workers put in doors, bolts, and bars. They cut stones and lifted them into place on the wall, and they filled in gaps and holes. All around the city, people worked side by side. Soon the wall was half as tall as it had once been! \\\\nBut not everyone was happy that Jerusalem\\\\u2019s walls were being rebuilt. Some men who lived nearby made a plan to attack them and stop their work. God\\\\u2019s people prayed and chose men to guard the walls all day and all night, but the people were discouraged. \\\\nNehemiah reminded the people that God was with them. \\\\u201cDon\\\\u2019t be afraid,\\\\u201d he said. \\\\u201cGod is great and powerful! Be ready. If our enemies attack us, God will fight for us!\\\\u201d Enemies could threaten God\\\\u2019s people, but they could not make God\\\\u2019s people stop building. Their enemies were not in charge of rebuilding the wall; God was! \\\\nSo God\\\\u2019s people went back to work. Some stood guard with weapons, and others worked on the wall. Some men worked with one hand and held a weapon in the other. They were always ready to fight, just in case. \\\\nNehemiah was a wise and good leader for God\\\\u2019s people. In just 52 days, the wall was complete! The gates were repaired, and the wall was restored. The city was ready for more of God\\\\u2019s people to come home. When all of Jerusalem\\\\u2019s enemies heard that the wall had been rebuilt, they were afraid because they knew God was with His people.\\\\u2009\\\\nChrist Connection: Nehemiah led the people to rebuild the walls around Jerusalem to protect them from their enemies. Jesus came to protect us from our greatest enemies, sin and death. He died on the cross and rose from the dead to rescue everyone who trusts in Him. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nREVIEW THE BIBLE STORY\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002 When Nehemiah was overcome with sadness, what was the first thing He did? Look at Nehemiah 1:4. [Choose a volunteer to read aloud Nehemiah 1:4.] Nehemiah sought the Lord through prayer. As he prayed, he remembered who the Lord is; that He is the God who always keeps His promises and loves His people. Even in a time of great distress, Nehemiah knew the Lord was with His people and heard their cries.\\\\nThe enemies of God\\\\u2019s people taunted them because they did not like that they were rebuilding the wall. They even made plans to attack the wall, but God protected His people. How did God show that He was in control? Look at Nehemiah 4:15. [Choose a volunteer to read Nehemiah 4:15.] God frustrated the plans of their enemies. This means that God made it so the enemies\\\\u2019 wicked plans would not happen.  \\\\nEventually, Nehemiah and the people completed the wall. When their enemies saw that they had completed this task, how did they respond? Look at Nehemiah 6:16. [Choose a volunteer to read aloud Nehemiah 6:16.] They saw that the work was completed with the help of the one true God. \\\\nIf we have received Jesus as Savior, God has completed the work of salvation for us. God sent His Son, Jesus, to conquer sin and death and to save those who receive Him as Lord. \\\\u2009\\\\nChrist connection\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002\\\\u2009Nehemiah led the people to rebuild the walls around Jerusalem to protect them from their enemies. Jesus came to protect us from our greatest enemies, sin and death. He died on the cross and rose from the dead to rescue everyone who trusts in Him.  \\\\u2009\\\\u2009\\\\n(Tip: Use Scripture and the Gospel Plan Poster to explain how to become a Christian.

Since COVID-19 has slowed down the pace of life in the area, many people make more time to listen and talk about God with others.  \\\\nTell the kids that Stephen and Erin Spencer met an elderly lady in a Southeast Asia village. Explain that the lady wondered if the Bible stories she heard were true. Tell the kids that she said to her family, \\\\u201cThere might be something to this living God they\\\\u2019re talking about.\\\\u201d Tell kids that one day, not long after she made that statement, the woman\\\\u2019s daughter came in to tell her that their pig had died. \\\\nSAY\\\\u2002 In this area, a pig can be sold for income that a family can live on for two to three months. The daughter asked, \\\\u2018Is there anything this \\\\u2018living God\\\\u2019 can do?\\\\u2019 The elderly lady went to the pigpen, where a crowd from the village had gathered. She crawled into the pigpen, got on her knees, and said, \\\\u2018God, if You\\\\u2019re real, then show these people that You\\\\u2019re real.\\\\u2019 While she was praying, the dead pig stood up. The woman believed in God, and she was baptized the next day. Many people have believed in Jesus after seeing the answered prayers of this elderly lady in the village. \\\\nPray, asking God to help the new believers grow in their faith and continue to tell other people in their village about Jesus.\\\\nKey passage ACTIVITY (5 minutes)\\\\nBefore the session, write out the key passage on index cards, writing only one word on each card. Create several sets depending on the size of your group. \\\\nSAY\\\\u2002\\\\u2009What is \\\\u2018godly grief\\\\u2019? [Allow kids to respond.] Godly grief means that we are genuinely sorry for our sin because it is an eternal offense against God. Godly grief should lead us to turn from sin and obey God because we love Him more than our sin.  \\\\u2009\\\\u2009\\\\nShow the key passage poster.

(Tip: Locate the areas in and around modern-day Jerusalem [H5].) \\\\nChoose a volunteer to read aloud Nehemiah 1:5-9. \\\\nSAY\\\\u2002 Nehemiah showed godly grief when he prayed to God. His sorrow over his own sin and the sin of his people caused him to seek repentance. He recognized that the destruction of Jerusalem was because God\\\\u2019s people had sinned. Nehemiah\\\\u2019s godly grief and repentance led him to right action. He trusted in God\\\\u2019s Word and remembered God\\\\u2019s promises. Nehemiah believed that one day God would dwell with His people. Because of his faith in God, he obediently acted to rebuild Jerusalem\\\\u2019s wall. \\\\u2009\\\\nGROUP DISCUSSION (10 minutes)\\\\nAsk the following questions. Lead the group to discuss.\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002 What can we learn from Nehemiah\\\\u2019s prayer in Nehemiah 1:4-11?  \\\\u2009\\\\nLead kids to understand that Nehemiah\\\\u2019s prayer praised God and His character, confessed sin, recounted God\\\\u2019s promises, and asked God for help. Help kids understand that there are no special words we have to pray, but that the Bible does help us know how to pray.\\\\n(Option: Choose a volunteer to read Matt. 6:9-13.)\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002 Does trusting God mean we always just sit back and wait? Why not? \\\\u2009\\\\nHelp kids understand that Nehemiah trusted the Lord to accomplish the rebuilding of the wall, but he didn\\\\u2019t sit back and do nothing. Remind kids that faith calls us to act upon what we believe. Encourage kids to trust God and be reminded that He is faithful to help us follow Him in obedience.\\\\n(Option: Choose a volunteer to read Matt. 7:24.)\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002 What does it mean that God restores our relationship with Him?  \\\\u2009\\\\nExplain that like the broken wall around Jerusalem, our relationship with the Lord is broken because of sin. Remind kids that God did what we could not do by sending Jesus to live a perfect life for us. Help kids understand that Jesus took the punishment our sin deserves, conquered death, and brings us back to God when we trust in Him as Savior. \\\\n(Option: Choose a volunteer to read Rom. 5:1.)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLIVE\\\\nTHE MISSION OF THE GOSPEL\\\\n\\\\nLIVE the Mission\\\\nActivity choice (10 minutes)\\\\nOption 1: Pigpens\\\\t \\\\nInflate 10 pink balloons and 10 purple balloons and draw pig faces on them.

The team who gets all of their pigs into the pigpen first is the winner. Play again if time allows. \\\\nSAY\\\\u2002\\\\u2009We learned that pigs are important animals for the people in Southeast Asia because they can be sold to provide money for the families. We also learned that God answered a woman\\\\u2019s prayer and raised a pig to life. God not only has the power to save pigs from dying, but He has the power to save people from sin and death too. Missionaries want to give people the hope of Jesus so they can be saved to live with God forever. \\\\nOption 2: Praying Scripture      \\\\nDistribute paper, pens or pencils, and a Bible to each kid. Encourage kids that praying does not have to be difficult and they do not have to have the perfect words to say while they pray. Lead kids to understand that we can pray the words \\\\nof Scripture. \\\\nWrite the references of several verses on a dry erase board. Some examples may include Psalm 19:14; Psalm 25:4; Psalm 27:1; Isaiah 25:1; Hebrews 13:6; and Ephesians 2:10. Choose to add your own as well. Challenge kids to look up and read one of the verses, turn that Scripture into a prayer, and write the prayer on their papers.\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002 In our story today, we learned that Nehemiah prayed Scripture. Praying Scripture helps keep our minds focused on truth and it reveals sin. It also causes our hearts to be moved to love God so that we desire to turn away from sin.  \\\\n\", \"header\": \"UNIT 18  |  SESSION 2\\\\nNehemiah Rebuilt the Walls\\\\nNehemiah 1\\\\u20137\\\\nKey Passage:\\\\n2 Corinthians 7:10\\\\nBig Picture Question:\\\\nHow should we feel when we sin?

How did you respond? \\\\nAnger and bitterness are common reactions to bad news. We may feel tempted to isolate ourselves from others. Grief is complex, and responses vary greatly. However, according to the Bible, Nehemiah\\\\u2019s response is the best response. \\\\nWe read about Nehemiah\\\\u2019s general response in Nehemiah 1:4. Then in Nehemiah 1:5-11, we discover the specific way that Nehemiah prayed in response to this devastating news. He recognized God\\\\u2019s faithfulness, requested God\\\\u2019s ear, confessed sin, and committed his people to the Lord\\\\u2019s care. \\\\nNehemiah began his prayer with a recognition of the faithfulness of God. He indicated his confidence that God had been and would continue to be faithful. He then requested God\\\\u2019s ear. Though Nehemiah was confident that God heard him, he opened and closed his prayer of dependence by begging God to listen to his request.  \\\\nWhy did Nehemiah pray this way? Likely, he was further demonstrating his deep conviction that God and God alone is able to work in such a way that would bring about restoration. \\\\nNehemiah\\\\u2019s prayer also demonstrates his belief that sin has serious consequences. He confessed his own sin and the sin of his family, recognizing that God was fully aware of their sin, but also that this sin was not to be taken lightly and needed to be dealt with. \\\\nFinally, he committed his family\\\\u2014the Jewish people\\\\u2014into the hands of this faithful and just God. He trusted God to be faithful to His word and His people.

With God\\\\u2019s help, the people finished rebuilding the walls and the city gates in just 52 days. Ezra (EZ ruh), a priest and scribe, had traveled from Babylon to Jerusalem with a group of God\\\\u2019s people. God was with Ezra, and Ezra wanted to study God\\\\u2019s law, obey it, and teach it to God\\\\u2019s people. \\\\nEzra met with some of the people of Israel. He learned that some of the people and their leaders had disobeyed God, ignoring His Word. Ezra tore his clothes and pulled out some of his hair. He sat down and was very upset. Ezra got on his knees and prayed to God, confessing the people\\\\u2019s sin. As he did this, God\\\\u2019s people began to gather around him. They cried too and offered sacrifices, promising to be faithful to God. \\\\nSeveral years later, the people in Jerusalem gathered together early in the morning at one of Jerusalem\\\\u2019s gates. Men, women, and children\\\\u2014anyone who could understand\\\\u2014came to listen to the reading of God\\\\u2019s Word. As the sun was just coming up, Ezra brought out the book of the law of Moses that God had given to His people. God\\\\u2019s words were written on a scroll. Ezra stood on a high wooden platform and began to read. \\\\nEzra read the law for hours, and all the people listened carefully. The people stood up; they had respect for God\\\\u2019s Word. Ezra praised God, and the people lifted up their hands. \\\\n\\\\u201cAmen! Amen!\\\\u201d they said. The people in the crowd bowed down with their faces to the ground, and they worshiped God. \\\\nSome of the leaders there\\\\u2014the Levites (LEE vights)\\\\u2014explained the law to the people and helped them understand the words Ezra read. As the people heard the words of the law, they began to cry. The law was God\\\\u2019s rules for living, and the people had disobeyed God. They realized they had sinned. \\\\nEzra, the Levites, and Nehemiah (NEE huh MIGH uh) the governor said, \\\\u201cThis day is holy to the Lord your God. Do not be sad or cry.\\\\u201d Even though the people\\\\u2019s sin made them sad, this was a happy day. \\\\nThen Ezra said to them, \\\\u201cGo home and prepare a feast! Eat rich food and drink sweet drinks. Share what you have prepared with those who have nothing prepared.\\\\u201d\\\\u2009 \\\\nThe people obeyed Ezra. They prepared a feast. They were glad because they understood the words of the law that were explained to them. \\\\nChrist Connection: God\\\\u2019s Word is powerful. When Ezra read God\\\\u2019s Word, the people loved God more and changed their ways. The Bible says that Jesus is \\\\u201cthe Word.\\\\u201d Jesus is God who came to live with people on earth. Jesus has the power to change our hearts. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nREVIEW THE BIBLE STORY\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002 God\\\\u2019s Word is powerful. Our story showed us how God used His Word to change the hearts of His people as Ezra taught the Scriptures. What made Ezra a good communicator of God\\\\u2019s Word? Look at Ezra 7:10. [Choose a volunteer to read aloud Ezra 7:10.] The Bible tells us that Ezra didn\\\\u2019t simply read God\\\\u2019s law to the people, but that Ezra spent time studying God\\\\u2019s Word and letting it change his heart. Ezra did not just tell the people what they should be doing, but he himself followed God\\\\u2019s law, then he taught God\\\\u2019s Word to the people. \\\\nAfter the people heard the law, what did Ezra tell them to do? Look at Ezra 10:11. [Choose a volunteer to read aloud Ezra 10:11.] God had convicted His people of their sin through the His Word. The people responded by being sorry for their sin, but Ezra encouraged them to go one step further by confessing their sins to the Lord and turning from their sinful ways. \\\\nWhen we sin against the Lord, we should be sorry for our sin and want to turn from our sin. Let\\\\u2019s say our big picture question and answer. How should we feel about sin? When we sin, we should feel sorry that we have disobeyed God and want to turn from our sin because we love Him. Through Jesus\\\\u2019 death and resurrection, we can experience freedom from sin and from the punishment sin requires. \\\\u2009\\\\nChrist connection\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002\\\\u2009God\\\\u2019s Word is powerful.

People in the village did not believe she would live much longer. The elderly lady asked the woman\\\\u2019s husband if she could pray for God to heal her. The husband agreed to let her pray for healing. The elderly woman told the man\\\\u2019s wife about Jesus and prayed for her. In 10 minutes, the woman who had been paralyzed and in pain was able to sit upright in a chair. The next day, the woman walked out of her house and met Stephen and Erin.

Consider comparing the Old Testament Kingdoms Map to a modern-day map to help kids understand where these stories took place. (Tip: Locate the areas in and around modern-day Jerusalem.)\\\\nChoose a volunteer to read aloud Ezra 9:6,9.\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002 Ezra recognized the grievousness of his sins and the people\\\\u2019s sins. He was so overwhelmed by how great their sin was that he could not even lift his face. Ezra recognized that sin is an eternal offense against an eternal, holy God. The guilt of sin is higher than the heavens. \\\\nBut Ezra also remembered the grace of God. Even though the people had not been faithful to the Lord or obeyed His commands, God was still faithful. He was still showing them steadfast love and protection. Like Ezra, we should be sorry for our sin and repent. Then, we should also remember that God has shown us steadfast love by sending Jesus to rescue us from sin and death. \\\\u2009\\\\nGROUP DISCUSSION (10 minutes)\\\\nAsk the following questions.

In Acts 3, Peter and John were used by God to heal a lame beggar. Peter told the beggar, \\\\u2018In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, get up and walk!\\\\u2019 Then the beggar was healed and praised God.

God\\\\u2019s people had gathered and were fasting and beginning to confess their sin when the priests chimed in with an appropriate pattern for how that confession ought to progress. \\\\nIn this text, we discover that true confession of sin will never come before genuine recognition of the holiness of God.

Nehemiah led God\\\\u2019s people in Jerusalem to repent and confess their sin. To show they were sorry for their sin, the people fasted. They wore sackcloth and put dust on their heads. They spent time reading and listening to God\\\\u2019s Word, confessing their sin, and worshiping the Lord. \\\\nLeaders stood and led God\\\\u2019s people in prayer: \\\\u201cBlessed be the LORD your God forever and ever,\\\\u201d they prayed. \\\\u201cYou, LORD, are the only God. You created the heavens and the earth and all that is on it, the seas and all that is in them. You give life to all of them, and all the stars of heaven worship You.\\\\u201d \\\\nThey remembered everything God had done in Israel\\\\u2019s past, praying, \\\\u201cYou chose Abram and changed his name to Abraham. You made a covenant with him and gave him the promised land. You kept Your promise, for You are righteous.\\\\u201d \\\\nThey also remembered how God had seen the Israelites\\\\u2019 suffering in Egypt and delivered them, dividing the Red Sea for them to cross. He led them with a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night. He gave them His law on Mount Sinai. He gave them bread and water in the wilderness. But the people had turned away from God. They worshiped idols and did not trust Him. Yet God was forgiving, gracious, and compassionate. He did not abandon them. \\\\nIn their praise to God, they also remembered how God gave His people kingdoms and multiplied them. They were successful and happy. But the people turned away from God. The people thought back to when God sent prophets to warn them, but they did not listen. God let their enemies take over, but He did not destroy or abandon them because God is gracious and compassionate. \\\\nThe leaders prayed, \\\\u201cNow today we are slaves in the land You gave our ancestors. We need help! So we promise to be faithful and worship only You.\\\\u201d The people agreed to follow God\\\\u2019s law. \\\\nThen the leaders and some of the people stayed in Jerusalem, and everyone else went to live in the cities nearby.\\\\nChrist Connection: God\\\\u2019s people remembered all He had done and promised to be faithful. God is gracious and compassionate. All along, God has been faithful to people who are unfaithful. We experience God\\\\u2019s grace and compassion in Jesus, who gave His life so we can receive mercy and life forever. \\\\u2009\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nREVIEW THE BIBLE STORY\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002 God\\\\u2019s people had a constant struggle with sin. They disobeyed God\\\\u2019s law and worshiped false gods. But God remained faithful to His people. God\\\\u2019s people often had to suffer the consequences of their sins, but God always heard their cries and was gracious toward them.\\\\nAfter reading God\\\\u2019s law, what did God\\\\u2019s people do? Look at Nehemiah 9:3. [Choose a volunteer to read aloud Nehemiah 9:3.] After the people read and heard God\\\\u2019s law, they realized the seriousness of their sin and confessed it to the Lord. They also responded by crying out to the Lord and worshiping Him for His faithfulness and mercy. \\\\nSometimes the sins of God\\\\u2019s people caused them to suffer. Was God being unfair or unkind in causing His people to fall into the hand of their enemies because of their disobedience? Look at Nehemiah 9:33. [Choose a volunteer to read aloud Nehemiah 9:33.] No! God is righteous. This means He always does what is right and good. And God was faithful even when His people disobeyed. Sin has consequences, but God, because of His great mercy and grace, provides a way for His people to be forgiven. He provided a way for His people to be delivered from their enemies and He provided a way for us to be saved from sin and death through His Son, Jesus. \\\\u2009\\\\nChrist connection\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002\\\\u2009God\\\\u2019s people remembered all He had done and promised to be faithful.

Prompt kids to discuss:\\\\nWhat if we still feel bad after asking forgiveness for sin? Is there anything else we need \\\\nto do?\\\\nGod is always faithful to His people. How has God been faithful to you?\\\\u2009\\\\u2009\\\\nMissions moment (3 minutes) \\\\nDisplay a world map and point to the area of Southeast Asia. Emphasize that sometimes missionaries face difficult situations in the places they serve, but they continue their work and trust God to help them. Point out that during the pandemic and government unrest, many missionaries serving in Southeast Asia could not leave their areas because they would be required to quarantine for two weeks in a government-run hospital when they returned. Other people also could not come into the areas. Explain that this meant many missionaries did not have anyone visit them or have the freedom to leave for over a year and a half.\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002 During these difficult days, missionaries were still faithful to share the gospel with the people of Southeast Asia. We can also be faithful to share the gospel when we face hard times. God can use an illness or a tragedy to help others see the hope of the gospel. \\\\nPray for missionaries around the world who are facing challenging times. Ask God to help them trust Him and hope in His promise to one day make all things new.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nKey passage ACTIVITY (5 minutes)\\\\nBefore the session, write each word of the key passage on a sticky note. Then place the sticky notes around the room.\\\\nShow the key passage poster. Lead kids in reading aloud 2 Corinthians 7:10 together.\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002\\\\u2009Our key passage talks about salvation.

Guide kids to open their Bibles to Nehemiah 9. Remind kids that God had been with Nehemiah to rebuild the wall around Jerusalem and that Nehemiah was now the governor. Explain that the priest Ezra was also present with Nehemiah to read the law and teach it to the people. \\\\nConsider comparing the Old Testament Kingdoms Map to a modern-day map to help kids understand where these stories took place. (Tip: Locate the areas in and around modern-day Jerusalem [H5].) \\\\nChoose a volunteer to read aloud Nehemiah 9:17.\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002 Through the reading of God\\\\u2019s Word, the people felt sorry for their sin. The people confessed their sin, and God heard the people\\\\u2019s cries for forgiveness. The people\\\\u2019s unfaithfulness to God was a sin, but God never stopped loving or caring for His people. He is faithful and always stands ready \\\\nto forgive.  \\\\nGod displayed His faithfulness and love toward us by sending Jesus to take the punishment our sin demands. Reading God\\\\u2019s Word helps us to understand that we should feel sorry for our sin, repent, and turn to Jesus. When we place faith in Jesus, we do not receive the punishment we deserve. Instead, we receive the gift of eternal life.  \\\\u2009\\\\nGROUP DISCUSSION (10 minutes)\\\\nAsk the following questions. Lead the group to discuss.\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002 How does remembering God\\\\u2019s faithfulness help us when we sin?  \\\\u2009\\\\nHelp kids understand that if we are saved by faith in Jesus, we can trust that God will be faithful to His promise to wash away our sin. Remind kids that Jesus died once for all our sin and that we are not guilty before God because of Jesus\\\\u2019 righteousness given to us by faith. Encourage kids to remember that God will be faithful to save them from sin and to help them fight against sin.\\\\n(Option: Choose a volunteer to read 1 John 1:9.)\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002 Why is it important to confess our sins?  \\\\u2009\\\\nRemind kids that we must acknowledge our sin against God and demonstrate that we could never live up to His perfect standards. Remind kids that confession of sin shows our need \\\\nfor Jesus. \\\\n(Option: Choose a volunteer to read 1 John 1:8.)\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002 How have you experienced God\\\\u2019s faithfulness in your own life? \\\\u2009\\\\nAnswers will vary.

Form kids into three groups and provide each group with a muffin tin filled with the labeled muffin liners and a pom-pom.\\\\nLead kids to take turns throwing the pom-pom into one of the muffin cups. Depending on where the ball lands, tell the kids to name something about the specific topic. If a kid needs assistance, offer hints to help him think of a response to the topic. End the activity after all kids have had a turn to toss the pom-pom into a cup and give a response. \\\\nSAY\\\\u2002It\\\\u2019s important to learn about the mission work being done around the world so we know how to pray for the missionaries and the people they are serving. We should also remember that we are also called to be faithful to share the gospel with others.  \\\\nOption 2: stones of remembrance     \\\\nBefore the session, cover the table or floor with a table covering to protect it from paint. Distribute two stones and one paint pen to each kid.

[Distribute Bibles to kids who need one.] \\\\nHave you ever had to apologize for something you did? How did it make you feel to apologize? [Allow kids to respond.] Sometimes saying \\\\u2018I\\\\u2019m sorry\\\\u2019 is hard, but it\\\\u2019s important that we recognize how we have sinned against God and against others. God\\\\u2019s Word tells us that we should be sorry when we sin, that we should confess our sin, and then turn away from sin. God is faithful to forgive us when we confess sin and place faith in Jesus.\\\\nToday\\\\u2019s Bible story takes us to the New Testament as we read from the Book of Romans. Romans was a letter written by the apostle Paul to the church in Rome. God used Paul to share important truths about how Christians are to live because of what Jesus has done for us. \\\\u2009\\\\nBig picture question (1 minute)\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002\\\\u2009Let\\\\u2019s recite our big truth question and answer together. How should we feel when we sin? When we sin, we should feel sorry that we have disobeyed God and want to turn from our sin because we love Him. \\\\nToday, our Bible story will help us learn that those who follow Jesus want to live differently. Because of God\\\\u2019s great mercy shown to us through Jesus, we have new hearts that want to obey God and not let sin rule over us. This doesn\\\\u2019t mean we won\\\\u2019t sin, but it does mean we ask God to help us turn from our sin because we love Him. \\\\u2009\\\\u2009\\\\nReview the timeline (1 minute)\\\\nShow the giant timeline. Point to individual Bible stories as you review.\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002\\\\u2009The Bible reminds us over and over again that people are not able to perfectly obey God and remain faithful to Him. But God remained faithful. He kept His promises and sent Jesus to obey the law perfectly for us. We cannot earn salvation, but if we believe in Jesus and all He has done for us, we can be saved from our sin. Today\\\\u2019s Bible story teaches us that Jesus not only saves us from the death sin brings, but also saves us to live rightly for God now. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2009\\\\u2009\\\\nLEARN the Bible Story\\\\nTELL THE BIBLE STORY: VIDEO OR STORYTELLER (10 minutes)\\\\nOpen your Bible to Romans 8. Use the Bible storytelling tips to help you tell the story, or show the Bible story video \\\\u201cWe Should Be Sorry for Sin.\\\\u201d Use the bold text to retell or review the story.\\\\nWe Should Be Sorry for Sin\\\\n \\\\u2009 Over and over in the Old Testament, God\\\\u2019s people promised to be faithful. God gave His law to show what He requires, but again and again, the people failed to obey perfectly. They rebelled and turned against God. Even when they wanted to obey God, they could never be good enough\\\\u2014no matter how hard they tried! Their sin made them guilty before God. They needed help. They needed a Savior. \\\\nAt just the right time, God kept His promise to send a Savior. Jesus came to rescue sinners. Sin is powerful, but Jesus is more powerful. A believer named Paul wrote about sin in a letter to Christians in Rome. Paul said that Jesus was the Savior the people had been waiting for. \\\\nThis is what Paul said: \\\\u201cNow there is no condemnation\\\\u2014no judgment or punishment\\\\u2014for those who have been saved by faith in Jesus. Why? Because the new law\\\\u2014the law of the Spirit\\\\u2014has set you free from the old law. The old law was written down, and it helped you understand that you are a sinner. The old law brought sin and death. God sent Jesus to defeat sin and death so that we could be made righteous by faith in Him and live through the Spirit. God has put the new law in our hearts. The new law brings life and peace.\\\\u201d \\\\nSo Paul talked about two ways of living: living by doing what our sinful self wants or living by doing what God wants. Since Jesus frees us from the power of sin, we can say no to sin. God gives us His Spirit and power to live in a way that honors God.  \\\\nPaul wanted to be clear: Being not guilty before God doesn\\\\u2019t mean we should keep on sinning. God\\\\u2019s Spirit in us gives us power to turn away from sin and obey God. When we let the Spirit lead us, we prove to be children of God. \\\\nGod doesn\\\\u2019t just change something in us; He changes us. God gives us a new heart\\\\u2014new desires and a new way of thinking. This is a miraculous gift from God. We still struggle with sin, but now what is most true about us is not that we are sinners but that we belong to Jesus.\\\\nChrist Connection: God sent Jesus to take the punishment our sin deserves. Because of Jesus, we have forgiveness of sins and eternal life. Through God\\\\u2019s Spirit, we have the power to turn away from sin and live to bring glory to God. \\\\u2009\\\\nREVIEW THE BIBLE STORY\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002 Paul begins Romans 8 with some amazing news! There is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. What does it mean that we no longer have condemnation? [Allow responses.] It means that those who have trusted in Jesus no longer face the punishment sin deserves but instead have been found innocent. Jesus perfectly obeyed God\\\\u2019s law and took our punishment for us when He died on the cross. \\\\nWhat does Romans 8:11 say? [Ask a volunteer to read Romans 8:11 and allow responses.] Paul reminds us that by faith in Jesus, His Spirit now lives in us and brings us new life. This is an important truth in the life of the believer because now we have the power to say no to sin. Because of what Jesus has done for us, the Spirit not only gives us new life but also helps us fight against sin.\\\\nWhat are the two ways of living Paul wrote about? [Ask a volunteer to read Romans 8: 13.] We can either live by following our sinful desires or live by the Spirit. If we live by obeying our sinful desires, then we will die. But if we live by the Spirit, and fight against sin by obeying God\\\\u2019s Word, we will live. Only Jesus can set us free from the law of sin and death. \\\\u2009\\\\nChrist connection\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002\\\\u2009God sent Jesus to take the punishment our sin deserves.

Remind kids that many people believed in Jesus when they saw miracles happen as the elderly lady prayed.\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002 We can thank God and praise Him for the way He has led people to believe in Jesus through the sharing of His Word and the prayers said. But there are still many people who need to know the hope of Jesus. Many people are without hope because of government unrest and they believe in many gods instead of the one true God. \\\\nLead the kids in prayer, asking that God will continue to help the Washingtons and Spencers as they work in Southeast Asia.

Rather, we live under the power of the Spirit.

Why not? \\\\u2009\\\\nHelp kids understand that until Jesus returns, we will continue to fight against sin.

Romans was a letter written by the apostle Paul to the church in Rome. God used Paul to share important truths about how Christians are to live because of what Jesus has done for us.\", \"big_picture\": \"Big picture question (1 minute)\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002\\\\u2009Let\\\\u2019s recite our big truth question and answer together. How should we feel when we sin? When we sin, we should feel sorry that we have disobeyed God and want to turn from our sin because we love Him. \\\\nToday, our Bible story will help us learn that those who follow Jesus want to live differently. Because of God\\\\u2019s great mercy shown to us through Jesus, we have new hearts that want to obey God and not let sin rule over us. This doesn\\\\u2019t mean we won\\\\u2019t sin, but it does mean we ask God to help us turn from our sin because we love Him.\", \"review_timeline\": \"Review the timeline (1 minute)\\\\nShow the giant timeline. Point to individual Bible stories as you review.\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002\\\\u2009The Bible reminds us over and over again that people are not able to perfectly obey God and remain faithful to Him. But God remained faithful. He kept His promises and sent Jesus to obey the law perfectly for us. We cannot earn salvation, but if we believe in Jesus and all He has done for us, we can be saved from our sin. Today\\\\u2019s Bible story teaches us that Jesus not only saves us from the death sin brings, but also saves us to live rightly for God now.\", \"christ_connection\": \"Christ connection\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002\\\\u2009God sent Jesus to take the punishment our sin deserves.

Lead the group to discuss.\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002 Can we ever do enough good things to earn salvation? Why not? \\\\u2009\\\\nRemind kids that no one can keep God\\\\u2019s law perfectly and no one can do enough good things to earn salvation. Lead kids to understand that Jesus obeyed God perfectly for us and died on the cross for our sins. \\\\nChoose a volunteer to read Eph. 2:8-9.\\\\n\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002 When God gives us new life in Jesus, does that mean we will never sin again? Why not? \\\\u2009\\\\nHelp kids understand that until Jesus returns, we will continue to fight against sin. Remind kids that life in the Spirit means that sin no longer rules over us and that in Christ we now have the power to turn away from sin and obey God. \\\\nChoose a volunteer to read Rom. 6:11-14.\\\\n\\\\nSAY\\\\u2002 How do we walk according to the Spirit? \\\\u2009\\\\nLead kids to understand that Romans 8:5 teaches us that we must have our minds set on the things of the Spirit so that we can walk by the Spirit.

Provide each group with paper, markers, scissors, and a hole punch. Lead each group to designate a kid to trace his hand, another to trace her foot, and the third kid to draw a heart. Ask kids who drew a hand to write Serve One Another on the hand. Lead kids who traced their feet to write Share the Gospel on the feet. Finally, tell the kids who drew hearts to write Believe In Jesus on the hearts. \\\\nDirect kids to cut out their drawings and then to punch a hole on each hand, foot, and heart. Invite the groups to work together to string the yarn through the holes to create one banner. Provide help as needed. Hang the banner somewhere in the room using tape. \\\\nSAY\\\\u2002\\\\u2009Missionaries serve others, share the gospel, and pray for others to believe in Jesus. Every time we see this banner we should be reminded to pray for mission work and to also ask God to help us tell others about Jesus. \\\\nOption 2: life through the spirit      \\\\nCreate a set of index cards and write the following on different cards: arguing, \\\\n2 Corinthians 13:11, jealousy, James 3:14-15, anger, Ephesians 4:31-32, idolatry, Colossians 3:5, lying, Colossians 3:9-10, unforgiveness, Colossians 3:12-13.
